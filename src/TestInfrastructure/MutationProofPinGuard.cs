/// <summary>
/// Refuses to START a test run that has been declared part of a mutation proof - a BASELINE run or a
/// MUTATION ARM run - when the working tree is not exactly what that proof pinned. Every other run is
/// admitted untouched.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS - READ THIS BEFORE YOU DELETE IT OR WIDEN IT.
///
/// We prove a security guard is real by mutating the one primitive it depends on, running the whole suite
/// again, and reconciling the arithmetic: the tests that pass plus the tests that fail under the mutation
/// must add up to the tests that passed under the restored run. If they add up, the suite is held to have
/// observed the primitive.
///
/// That reconciliation has one failure it cannot see by itself, and it is the failure that matters most.
/// Suppose the BASELINE is taken on a tree where a security guard block has ALREADY been silently deleted
/// and left uncommitted. The tree still compiles. The suite still runs. The baseline still looks green and
/// complete. Then the mutation arm runs on that same contaminated tree, and the two runs reconcile
/// PERFECTLY - because they agree with each other, not because either one measured anything. The cheapest
/// detector we own passes while measuring nothing, and every conclusion drawn from it is worthless with
/// nothing anywhere in the process saying so.
///
/// This is not hypothetical. On 2026-07-19 a worker found exactly that on disk: a security guard block that
/// a KILLED run had deleted and never restored, because a process that is killed skips its cleanup. A sweep
/// of the mission's working trees that night found four dirty trees.
///
/// AND IT IS AN INSTRUCTION THAT CANNOT BIND. Telling every worker "check your tree is clean before you
/// take a baseline" does not work, and the reason is the whole design argument for this file: the worker
/// who INHERITS a contaminated tree is, by definition, the one who does not know there is a mutation in it.
/// It looks clean to them because it compiles and the tests pass. This is the same shape as the problem the
/// per-user suite lock in this repository was built for: a rule that requires global knowledge cannot be
/// obeyed by an actor holding only local knowledge. Four workers were each told not to run two suites at
/// once, each complied with everything it could observe, and four suites ran concurrently anyway. That one
/// was solved by a mechanism rather than a briefing, and so is this.
///
/// WHAT IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT: A BLANKET REFUSAL ON ANY DIRTY TREE.
///
/// A worker halfway through a rework is legitimately dirty and must be able to run whatever it likes,
/// whenever it likes. Only a baseline and a mutation arm carry a MEANING that depends on the tree being
/// exactly the pinned head. A blanket guard would be switched off inside a day, and a guard that gets
/// switched off protects nothing at all. So an unpinned run is never REFUSED, whatever state its tree is in.
///
/// WHAT AN UNPINNED RUN DOES COST, stated plainly because an earlier version of this comment claimed the
/// guard was "inert" and did "not even invoke git" unless pinned, and that was simply untrue. Every run of
/// every test assembly invokes git twice - once for the head, once for the working tree's changes - and
/// appends one line to a log outside the tree. That is roughly a fifth of a second per assembly against a
/// suite measured in minutes, and it is deliberate: it is the entire reason a FORGOTTEN pin is still
/// answerable afterwards. But it is a real cost on every ordinary run, it is not nothing, and anybody
/// weighing this mechanism should weigh what it actually does.
///
/// HOW A RUN DECLARES ITSELF PART OF A PROOF, AND WHY THAT IS HARD TO FORGET.
///
/// The declaration is made ONCE PER PROOF, not once per run, by writing a pin for the working tree
/// (scripts/mutation-proof-pin.ps1). From that moment until the pin is released, EVERY test run in that
/// tree is checked - the baseline, the arm, and any re-run of either. So the only moment a worker can
/// forget is the moment before the proof starts, and at that moment forgetting means something visible:
/// the pin is the only place the pinned head is written down, and a mutation proof with no recorded pinned
/// head is not a proof anybody can write up. The un-guarded path is not "skip a flag on the command line",
/// it is "have no pinned head at all".
///
/// It is not, and cannot honestly be claimed to be, impossible to forget - see the RUN RECORD below, which
/// is what closes the remainder.
///
/// THE ARM IS CHECKED TOO, AND AGAINST A TIGHTER RULE THAN THE BASELINE.
///
/// A mutation arm is SUPPOSED to be dirty - that is what a mutation is. So the arm's pin declares which
/// paths the mutation touches, and the guard requires the working tree to carry EXACTLY those changes:
///
///   - a change to a path the pin did not declare is refused, which is the contaminated-arm case, and
///   - a declared path that is NOT modified is refused, which is the case where the mutation was never
///     applied or was already restored. That one matters as much as the first: an arm run with no mutation
///     in it is a second baseline wearing an arm's name, and it reconciles perfectly against the first.
///
/// A baseline is simply an arm that declares no mutations, so both phases run one rule.
///
/// THE SECOND JOB: MAKE THE TREE'S STATE AT RUN TIME OUTLIVE THE TREE.
///
/// Refusing a contaminated run is only half of what this mechanism is for. On 2026-07-19 somebody was asked
/// whether four ALREADY-MERGED security proofs had been taken on contaminated trees. The answer could not be
/// given - not because the evidence was hard to find, but because it no longer existed. Those proofs were
/// run in worktrees, and the worktrees were removed after merging, which is correct hygiene and also
/// destroyed the only artifact that could have answered the question. Those four are recorded as unknown
/// and will stay unknown forever.
///
/// So every run appends a line to a LEDGER that lives outside every working tree, in the same per-user
/// neighbourhood as the suite lock, and therefore survives "git worktree remove", "git clean -xdf", and the
/// deletion of the whole checkout. Six months from now the question "was that proof taken on a clean tree at
/// the pinned head" is answered by reading a file, not by reconstructing a directory that is gone.
///
/// THE LEDGER STATES A POSITIVE FACT, NOT THE ABSENCE OF A COMPLAINT. It writes on ADMISSION as well as on
/// refusal, and an admission line says which head was verified and that the tree matched it. A log written
/// only when something goes wrong cannot afterwards distinguish "verified clean" from "the guard never
/// ran" - both are silence, and silence reads as success. That is the same principle the firing tests are
/// built on: an instrument that cannot observe its subject reports the subject's absence.
///
/// UNPINNED RUNS ARE OBSERVED, NEVER REFUSED. They are recorded too - head, and the tree's changed paths -
/// which is what makes a FORGOTTEN pin recoverable: when a proof's numbers are later questioned, the record
/// says whether the tree was dirty at the moment the baseline ran, even though no pin was ever written.
/// Recording NEVER refuses and NEVER fails a run; a diagnostic that can break a run is worse than no
/// diagnostic.
///
/// WHERE THE PIN LIVES: OUTSIDE THE WORKING TREE.
///
/// Two reasons, both load-bearing. A pin file inside the tree would itself be a working-tree change, so the
/// guard would trip over its own declaration or would need an exemption - and an exemption is a hole. And a
/// pin inside the tree is removed by "git clean -xdf", which is exactly the sort of housekeeping a worker
/// runs in the middle of a proof. So pins live under the per-user local application data directory, keyed
/// by the working tree's path, alongside the suite lock's home.
///
/// WHY A MODULE INITIALIZER. It runs on assembly load, before any test, under every runner, and there is no
/// call site for anybody to forget. It is the same form the per-user suite lock and the storage-root
/// redirect already use in this repository. This file is linked into EVERY project whose name ends in
/// ".Tests" by Directory.Build.props, so a test project added next year is covered without anybody
/// remembering - keying on the project name rather than on the IsTestProject flag was deliberate, because
/// one of the seven existing test projects does not set that flag.
///
/// It is pinned by MutationProofPinGuardTests, because a guard that silently fails to run leaves no trace
/// and looks exactly like a guard that works.
