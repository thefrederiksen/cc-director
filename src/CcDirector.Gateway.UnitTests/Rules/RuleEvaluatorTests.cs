///     counts every call to the one method that can type - together with the recorded firing that says
///     what it WOULD have typed. The count alone would pass just as happily if the evaluator had crashed
///     before reaching the send, which is why the record is asserted alongside it.
///   * THE SCREEN IS RE-READ IMMEDIATELY BEFORE ACTING, and a screen that changed between the decision and
