/// "only a person moves it" proved only that a direct call worked - the caller in it had no property that
/// made it a person.

/// So these tests are written the other way round, exactly as the ruling asks: they show a caller that is
/// NOT a person being REFUSED. A promotion with no grant is refused; a grant that names nobody cannot be
/// minted; a grant with no acknowledgement cannot be minted; and a grant obtained for one rule cannot be
/// turned on another.
