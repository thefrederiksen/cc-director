/// THE EVALUATOR AGAINST THE REAL STORE, over the real migrated schema.
///
/// Every other evaluator test holds a fake store, which is right for what those tests ask: they are about
/// what the evaluator DOES. This file asks the question a fake cannot answer - what happens when the thing
/// that has to write the record REFUSES - and the answer used to be "the keystroke has already gone".
///
/// The failure is not hypothetical. A rule can be deleted while the model is being asked; that gap is the
/// longest in the pass. The store then refuses to record a firing against a rule that no longer exists,
/// and before this round that refusal arrived AFTER text had been typed into somebody's session, leaving
/// the action with nothing durable to account for it.
///
/// The send seam is instrumented, so "nothing was typed" here is a counted fact about the one method that
/// can type rather than the absence of a log line.
