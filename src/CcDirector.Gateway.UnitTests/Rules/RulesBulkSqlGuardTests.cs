/// statement that was never written is a fault that cannot happen. So this fails the moment any production
/// type starts issuing one against these two tables, which is a review-time answer rather than an
/// incident-time one.

/// It is scoped to the rule entities on purpose. Bulk operations are legitimate elsewhere in the Gateway -
/// the activity log, the session history, the device registry all prune with them - and a blanket ban
