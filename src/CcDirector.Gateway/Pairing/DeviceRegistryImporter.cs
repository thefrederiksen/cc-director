/// inserts one row per device, and records a <see cref="DeviceImportMarkerEntity"/> - all inside a SINGLE
/// database transaction, so either the whole import commits or nothing does. The marker is what makes a second
/// run a no-op: the JSON file is never re-imported, so a restart, redeploy, or retry can neither duplicate a

/// tested component: it populates the new schema from the old file, losslessly and once.
///
/// It writes through <see cref="GatewayDatabase.CreateUnscopedContext"/> because <c>device_credentials</c> is a
/// GLOBAL table (no tenant query filter) that spans every tenant's devices, exactly like the <c>tenants</c>
