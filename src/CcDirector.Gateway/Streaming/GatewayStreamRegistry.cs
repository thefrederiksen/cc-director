/// Gateway Cleanup mission, Phase 0 (up-stream): the Gateway's registry of live up-streams, keyed by the
/// fresh stream id the Gateway minted when it opened the stream over the tunnel. It maps a stream id to the
/// browser-facing <see cref="IStreamSink"/>, and its <see cref="ConsumeAsync"/> is what the hub's StreamUp
/// method calls to pump the Director's frames into that sink.
///
/// Three of the Architect's four binding refinements live here (the fourth, bounded frames, lives in the
/// producer and the contract):
///  1. Backpressure (ruling 1): <see cref="ConsumeAsync"/> is pull-then-forward - it awaits the sink write of
///     one frame BEFORE pulling the next frame from the Director's up-stream. A slow sink therefore stalls the
///     pull, which (with a small SignalR StreamBufferCapacity) blocks the Director's producer. Bounded memory
///     end to end; this is the whole reason for native streaming, not an optimization.
///  3. close-stream / lifecycle races (ruling 3): a StreamUp that arrives after its sink is already gone is a
///     safe no-op (nothing to pump into); a StreamUp that never arrives after an open is torn down by a
///     timeout so a sink is never left waiting forever. Stream ids are fresh Guids and never reused, so no
///     late frame can alias a later stream.
