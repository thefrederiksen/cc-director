/// THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR. It is NOT the only door, and the difference is worth being exact about,

/// <see cref="RuleCallValidator"/>, and that was false: the entity, its setters, the DbSet and the context
/// factory are all public, so a caller could build a rule with an arbitrary call document, an arbitrary
/// tenant and a live state, add it and save it - meeting nothing in this file. An independent inspection
/// found the claim and the code disagreeing.
///
/// The claim was made TRUE rather than deleted. The validator, dry run and the tenant check now run in
/// <c>GatewayDbContext.SaveChanges</c>, which every route to the table ends at, so the structural boundary
/// exists where the claim always said it did. What this file adds on top of that gate is the plain-English
/// refusal a person reads: which check was named, which value was missing, and what the product ships.

/// DRY RUN IS ENFORCED, NOT DOCUMENTED. <see cref="Create"/> takes no state and always writes a dry-run
/// rule, so no caller can create a live one, and the write gate refuses a new rule that is not in dry run

/// <see cref="RulePromotionGrant"/> - evidence, mintable only from an authenticated request, that names
