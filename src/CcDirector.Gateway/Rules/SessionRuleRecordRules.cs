/// These invariants used to live in <see cref="SessionRuleStore"/> alone. The write gate in
/// <c>GatewayDbContext.SaveChanges</c> then grew up beside them and checked FOUR things - the tenant, the
/// call document, the initial dry-run state and the promotion marker - so a rule with no instruction, no
/// screen description, no trigger words, no cooldown and no daily cap went straight through it while the
/// store refused every one of those. Two boundaries disagreeing about what a rule is means one of them is
/// not a boundary, and the independent inspection of landing B found exactly that.
///
/// So there is one implementation and two call sites. The store calls it early, before it touches the
/// database, so a refusal costs nothing and reads as a refusal about the CALL; the gate calls it on every
/// save, so a caller that went round the store meets the same rules. Neither can drift from the other,
/// because there is nothing to drift from.
///
/// The refusals are written for a person to read. A rule that cannot be stored and does not say why is
/// worse than no rule at all.
