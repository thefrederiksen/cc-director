/// <summary>
/// THE EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON ASKED FOR A RULE TO GO LIVE. Dry run is the owner's most important bound -
/// it is what puts a human between a standing instruction and its first real use - and bound 6 forbids a
/// rule promoting itself.
///
/// THIS TYPE HAS BEEN WRONG TWICE, AND BOTH VERSIONS ARE WORTH KEEPING WRITTEN DOWN, because each one read
/// as a bound while being a convention:
///
///  1. <c>Promote</c> first took a rule id and a timestamp and nothing else, so anything that could read
///     rules could move one to live. The independent inspection of landing A found it.
///  2. This type was then introduced - and its factory was PUBLIC and took the caller's identity and their
///     acknowledgement as STRINGS. It proved that two strings a caller made up were not blank. Any Gateway
///     code could invent both, and the comment sitting beside it said nothing automated could promote a
///     rule. The independent inspection of landing B found that.
///
/// WHAT IT ENFORCES NOW, STATED EXACTLY, because a security bound described more broadly than it holds is
/// worse than none:
///
///  - A grant cannot be constructed: the constructor is private and a structural test asserts that nothing
///    in the built assembly calls it.
///  - The only way to obtain one is <see cref="FromAuthenticatedRequest"/>, which is INTERNAL - so nothing
///    outside this assembly can reach it at all - and which takes THE INBOUND REQUEST ITSELF rather than a
///    description of one. The caller identity is read from what the request pipeline authenticated. Code
///    with no inbound request has nothing to pass, and cannot invent a value that would do instead.
///  - Inside this assembly, a structural test over the built code asserts that the ONLY type reaching the
///    factory, or reaching <c>SessionRuleStore.Promote</c>, is the promote endpoint. That guard has been
///    watched failing on exactly the shape it is there to catch: a probe was committed that minted a grant
///    from ordinary rules code, and the guard named it.
///  - A grant names ONE rule and is SINGLE USE. It is consumed by the promotion it was obtained for, so a
///    grant cannot be captured and replayed, and cannot be turned on a different instruction.
///  - A SESSION KEY IS REFUSED HERE, ON THE CREDENTIAL ITSELF (fix round D, ruling D11). The route guard
///    already refuses the promote route to an agent's credential; this is the second, deliberately
///    redundant refusal at the destination, for the day a route change moves that boundary without
///    anybody noticing. Authentication is not authorization: the route list saying "not through this
///    door" is one decision, and this is the destination asking "who is this?" for itself.
///
/// AND ONE THING THIS TYPE GOT WRONG A THIRD TIME, found in fix round D while writing the direct tests:
/// it read the device off an item named "DeviceKeyId" that nothing in the Gateway ever wrote, and the
/// middleware never sets a principal - so every real device-key request reaching the promote route was
/// refused as having no caller, while the unit tests, whose helper set the same made-up item, were green.
/// The caller is now read through the middleware's OWN constants and identity types, and the test helper
/// marks a request the way the middleware does, so the two can no longer agree with each other and with
/// nothing else.
///
/// WHAT IT DOES NOT ENFORCE. It is not proof that a human being was at a keyboard - nothing inside a
/// process can be. Within one assembly, access modifiers cannot make a capability physically unreachable
/// either: code in this assembly could fabricate an <see cref="HttpContext"/> and stamp an identity on it.
/// What stands against that is not a hope - it is a structural test that reads the built assembly and
/// fails on any type but the endpoint reaching this factory, so doing it would be a visible, reviewable act
/// and not a quiet one. An attacker already holding a device key is authentication's problem, not this
/// bound's.
