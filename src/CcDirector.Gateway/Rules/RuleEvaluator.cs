/// normally - costs one screen read and nothing else and never reaches a model. Then ONE agent call
/// covering every surviving rule (Architect ruling A5), whose reply is validated against what was offered.
/// Then the checks the agent staked its decision on. Then, immediately before the keystroke and not a
/// moment earlier, the screen is READ AGAIN: a session that has moved on since the decision is abandoned.
/// And a rule in dry run never reaches the send at all.
///
/// ONE PASS AT A TIME PER SESSION, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE CEILING A CEILING. Every turn-end signal
/// starts its own pass, and the free checks read a rule's prior firings BEFORE the agent call and before
/// anything is typed. Two passes that overlap in that window both see no act yet and both go on to act -
/// past the cooldown and past the daily cap, because each was counted against a record neither had written
/// to. The independent inspection of landing B proved exactly that with a synchronised probe: two
/// evaluations, two sends, two firing records. A ceiling a race can walk through is not a ceiling, and an
/// agent in a loop is the worst tail risk this feature has.
///
/// So a pass takes a per-session gate FIRST, before it reads anything, and a pass that cannot take it does
/// NOTHING and says so - <see cref="RulePassOutcomes.AlreadyEvaluating"/>. It does not queue. Queuing would
/// hand the waiting pass a decision made about a screen from before the one that was just acted on, which
/// is the same staleness the re-read exists to refuse; and a queue of stale passes behind a slow model call
/// is a pile-up nobody asked for. Dropping the overlapping pass is the direction that acts LESS, and the
/// next turn-end brings another one along.
///
/// SILENCE IS NEVER A DECISION. Every outcome that is not "there was nothing to look at" is written down as
/// a firing - the decline, the abandonment, and the refusal of an unreadable reply included. A rule that
/// did nothing because this code threw looks exactly like a rule that considered the screen and declined,
/// unless the decline is on the record. So the record is the proof, and the absence of a keystroke is not.
