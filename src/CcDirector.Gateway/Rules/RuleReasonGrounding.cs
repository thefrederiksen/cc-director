/// This exists because of one live run. A rule declined, and its recorded reason quoted a sentence that was
/// not on the screen the firing record stores - the words had been on that session's screen twelve minutes
/// earlier, in an unrelated run. The decline was safe, because declining is the direction that does
/// nothing. THE SAME UNFAITHFULNESS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION IS A RULE ACTING ON EVIDENCE THAT WAS NOT
/// THERE, and that is the sharpest thing this mission has learned about its own design.
///
/// So: an ACT whose stated reason quotes text the screen does not contain is REFUSED. A DECLINE that does
/// the same is recorded as it happened - declining is safe and the record should show what actually
/// occurred - but recorded with the mismatch NOTED, so the unfaithfulness is visible rather than smoothed
/// over.
///
/// AND AN ACT MUST CITE SOMETHING AT ALL. The first version of this refused a reason that quoted words the
/// screen does not contain, and called a reason that quoted NOTHING grounded - "there was nothing to
/// check". An agent could then avoid the whole bound by writing a plausible sentence with no quotation in
/// it, and act on evidence nobody can go back and verify. That is an ABSENCE being read as a positive
/// result, which is the exact shape this mission's own standard forbids. So an act now needs a citation
/// present AND correct; see <see cref="RuleGrounding.CanCarryAnAct"/>. A decline needs neither, and its
/// record says which it had.
///
/// WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It checks QUOTED passages: text the reason puts in quotation marks
/// is a claim about what the screen says, and that claim is checkable. It does not check paraphrase, and it
/// cannot - a reason that says the screen "looks like a limit notice" is a judgement, and judging the
/// judgement is what the agent was asked for in the first place. So this is a floor, not a proof of
/// faithfulness, and the report says so. In particular a citation that IS on the screen does not make the
/// conclusion drawn from it correct; it makes the conclusion checkable by a person reading the record.
