/// step lives, so every surface that has to know "is this session sitting on a menu right now?" asks
/// the same question and gets the same answer: the wingman voice endpoint, the prompt front door's
/// menu guard, and the narration generator.
///
/// The read goes through <see cref="GatewayScreenReader.ReadLiveAsync"/> (the Terminal Rules mission,
/// issue #2644), so it is answered from the Gateway's own screen store when the store can PROVE the
/// stored screen is still what is on that terminal, and by a live tunnel pull otherwise. A read neither
/// can answer is UNREADABLE and arrives here as a null grid - the same null the tunnel pull returned
/// before the store existed, so every fail-closed branch below is unchanged.
///
/// It costs at most one tunnel read and NO model call - the classifier is pure. That is what makes it usable
/// on the send path (where a model call would add seconds to every spoken reply) and on the narration
/// path (where it must not add provider cost to a turn).
///
/// Fail-closed is inherited from the classifier: an unreadable, blank, or ambiguous screen resolves to
/// <see cref="WaitingScreenKind.Blocked"/>, never to a menu and never to a typeable composer.
