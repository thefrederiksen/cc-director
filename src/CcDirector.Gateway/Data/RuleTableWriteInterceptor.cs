/// <summary>
/// THE HALF OF THE WRITE GATE THAT SaveChanges CANNOT SEE.
///
/// <c>GatewayDbContext.GuardRuleWrites</c> runs from <c>SaveChanges</c> and reads the change tracker. Bulk
/// operations do not go near either: an ORM bulk update issues its SQL immediately and tracks nothing, so
/// one line could move a rule from dry run to live - the single transition this whole feature exists to
/// put a person in front of - without ever meeting the gate. The independent inspection of landing B did
/// exactly that and read the rule back as live. A bulk delete could erase the firing record the same way,
/// and the record is the product.
///
/// So the rule tables are closed at the LAST place every route passes: the command itself. An UPDATE or a
/// DELETE naming either table is refused unless it was issued by a save that has already been through the
/// gate, which the context says by holding <c>SavingThroughTheGate</c> for the duration of that save.
///
/// WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It matches the command TEXT, which is a blunt instrument, and it is deliberate:
/// there is no earlier hook that sees a bulk operation at all, and a check that cannot see the thing it is
/// guarding is not a check. It refuses only UPDATE and DELETE, so schema migration - which creates and
/// alters, and never updates a rule row - is untouched. Reads are untouched. And nothing in this Gateway
/// issues bulk SQL against these tables anyway; a structural test says so and names any type that starts.
/// This exists so that "nothing does" is not the only thing standing between a rule and being made live by
/// one line.
