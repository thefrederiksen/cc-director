/// The DAILY dictionary-suggestion scan (devthrottle issue #2115): for each tenant, run one suggestion scan
/// just after midnight in that tenant's OWN time zone (the per-account time zone setting on the Settings
/// page). The timer in <c>GatewayHost</c> ticks this sweep every few minutes; the sweep itself decides, per
/// tenant, whether that tenant's local 00:05 has passed since its last scan - so a tenant in Copenhagen and a
/// tenant in Sydney each get their scan at their own midnight from the same timer.
///
/// THE STORED SCAN ROW IS THE DURABLE MARKER: "has this tenant's daily scan run" is answered by the scan
/// store's <c>ScannedAtUtc</c>, so a Gateway restart never double-runs a tenant's day and never skips one. A
/// tenant with NO stored scan at all is due immediately - the first sweep after this feature ships (or after
/// a new tenant enrolls) seeds the stored result instead of leaving the badge dark until midnight. An
/// explicit "Scan now" also refreshes the marker, which simply means the daily run happens at most once per
/// local day across both triggers.
