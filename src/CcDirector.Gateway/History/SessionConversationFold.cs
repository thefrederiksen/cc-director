/// Folds what the Gateway HOLDS of one session's conversation into the <see cref="SessionHistoryDto"/> the
/// Chat screen renders (the turn-push mission, phase 2). Before this, Chat asked the owning Director for
/// the conversation every 2.5 seconds and the Director re-parsed the whole transcript for each poll; now
/// the Director pushes it once and this reads rows.
///
/// THE JOB THIS DOES BEYOND COPYING ROWS. "There are no messages" has several causes and they are not the
/// same news to the person looking at an empty screen:
///
///   this session is not known here     - nothing has ever arrived about it; the id may be wrong.
///   this agent keeps no conversation   - nothing will ever appear, and that is not a fault.
///   that computer has not checked in   - it cannot send anything until it reconnects.
///   that computer cannot send it       - its DevThrottle is too old to push conversations. Update it.
///   nothing has been sent yet          - the Director has it and has not pushed it; wait a moment.
///   the conversation has not started   - the session is here and has simply not spoken.
///
/// The client used to guess between two of these from a boolean and show "Waiting for the conversation to
/// start..." for all the rest, which is the sentence that makes a person sit and wait for something that is
/// never coming. So the sentence is decided HERE and rendered verbatim, like every other display verdict in
/// this product (CLAUDE.md rule 7). The client keeps exactly one line of its own - the one about its OWN
/// filters hiding messages - because the Gateway cannot know what a reader has filtered out.
///
/// WHAT "CONNECTED" MEANS HERE, precisely. It is the same freshness lease the rest of the product reads a
/// Director's presence through: a Director counts as connected while its last push is younger than the
/// stale-after window. So a machine that dropped a moment ago still reads as connected until that window
/// expires, and the screen can be up to that long out of date about it. That is deliberate - the roster is
/// built to ride out reconnect blips rather than flap - and it is written down here because a sentence
/// about someone's computer being offline should not quietly mean something narrower than it says.
