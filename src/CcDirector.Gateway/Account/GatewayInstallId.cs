/// Loads or creates THIS Gateway's stable, per-machine install identity (issue #857).
///
/// The Gateway is one process per machine and needs a single stable identifier that survives restarts,
/// so that "sign in = register this device" (issue #857) is idempotent: the same install id is sent on
/// every registration and heartbeat, so the cloud (idempotent per member + install id) keeps exactly one
/// device record for this machine instead of creating a new one on each launch.
///
/// There was no pre-existing Gateway install id to reuse: legacy account event reporting accepted an
/// install id parameter (issues #57/#40) but the Gateway injects a no-op reporter, so that seam is never
/// populated on the Gateway, and the local pairing registry (issue #469) keys off client-supplied device
/// ids, not the Gateway's own. This store therefore establishes the ONE canonical Gateway identity rather
/// than minting a second competing id - and any future Gateway-side install-id need should read it here.
///
/// Persisted as a single file under the same per-user config root the local device key and the
/// Director identity already use:
///     %LOCALAPPDATA%\cc-director\config\director\gateway-install-id.txt
/// Locked to the current user by living under that per-user root.
