/// <summary>
/// The in-memory answer to "which sessions hold a PENDING dictation", kept current by the WRITE path so the
/// read path never touches the disk.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. <see cref="VoiceUploadStore.IsSessionLocked"/> is asked once per session, every five
/// seconds, by the display-state fold. It used to answer by re-listing the staging root and re-reading every
/// upload's record.json - so the cost was O(sessions x staged uploads) per pass, and because a staging
/// directory is only removed on the success path, every abandoned dictation raised that cost permanently.
/// On a self-hosted Gateway that is wasted local I/O. On the HOSTED Gateway the staging root is an Azure
/// Files share that BILLS PER FILE OPEN, and it measured 5.5 million opens a day - more than the App Service
/// plan the Gateway runs on, to answer a question whose answer is identical for every session in a tick.
///
/// The same defect was found and fixed on the Director side (see
/// <c>CcDirector.Core.Sessions.DictationLockReader.LockedSessionIds</c>, issue #1111) by enumerating ONCE per
/// tick instead of once per session. This goes further, because it can: the Gateway is the ONLY writer of
/// these records - every transition arrives through its own REST endpoints in
/// <c>GatewayDictationEndpoint</c> - so it does not need to re-read a file to learn something it just wrote.
/// The disk stays the DURABLE record (it must: a restart, and the Director's own cross-process reader on
/// self-host, both still read it); this is a cache of it, owned by its single writer.
///
/// WHY IT IS AN OBJECT AND NOT A STATIC. A static index keyed by tenant would be shared by every
/// <see cref="VoiceUploadStore"/> in the process, including two stores rooted at different directories with
/// the same tenant - which is exactly the shape the unit tests build (many temp roots, all
/// <c>TenantId.Local</c>), so one test's pending marker would answer another test's question. The index is
/// therefore keyed by the PARTITION ROOT - the same directory the enumeration it replaces would have walked -
/// and is handed down through <see cref="VoiceUploadStore.ForTenant"/>, so one real Gateway shares one index
/// across all its tenants while a freshly constructed store starts empty.
///
/// FAIL-OPEN IS PRESERVED EXACTLY. The enumeration this replaces treats an unreadable root or a half-written
/// marker as NO LOCK, never a false lock, because a false lock silently refuses a user's typing. So does
/// this: a hydration that throws leaves the partition UNHYDRATED (it is marked hydrated only on success), the
/// caller is told "no lock" for that pass, and the next call tries again. The failure mode of a broken disk
/// is therefore "the lock stops being enforced", identical to before - not "the session is locked forever".
