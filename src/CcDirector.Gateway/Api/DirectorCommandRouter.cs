/// Issue #1177 (Phase 1): the ONE place the Gateway sends a command DOWN the Director's stream (the tunnel).
/// Every command endpoint routes through <see cref="TrySendAsync"/> so the send decision - and the
/// request-DTO serialization - is uniform across verbs and cannot diverge.
///
/// The send itself lives in the injected <paramref name="sendCommand"/> delegate
/// (<c>GatewayHost.SendCommandAsync</c>). Gateway Cleanup (the cut) made the tunnel MANDATORY and deleted
/// DirectorEndpointClient, so there is NO HTTP fallback: a null return here means the Director is not
/// tunnel-connected and the command is UNROUTABLE - the endpoint surfaces that as a 502, never an HTTP dial.
/// A non-null result - success OR a typed failure - is authoritative.
///
/// Stable Release (v1.3.0), Tier 1 item 1 - a dropped command must explain itself. Because this is the one
/// chokepoint, the wait is bounded HERE and nowhere else, so it cannot diverge across verbs. Three non-success
/// outcomes are now distinguishable to the caller, each naming what actually happened in plain English:
///   1. The Director is not tunnel-connected  - null, surfaced as a 502. Unchanged.
///   2. The Director answered nothing in time - <see cref="DirectorCommandStatus.Timeout"/>.
///   3. The tunnel dropped mid-command       - <see cref="DirectorCommandStatus.TunnelDropped"/>.
/// There is no retry and no degraded path: a bounded wait that expires fails loudly and says so.
