/// <c>/sessions/{sid}/{**rest}</c> catch-all onto THE TUNNEL. This verb TABLE is the explicit set the catch-all
/// route serves - it is NOT a generic HTTP passthrough (the old HTTP reverse-proxy leg was deleted at the cut).
/// The caller resolves the owner via <see cref="Streaming.PushedSessionStore.TryLocate"/> (a located owner is
/// always tunnel-connected); a request whose (method, rest-path) is not a mapped verb returns false so the
/// caller answers 404. There is NO HTTP fallback.
///
/// The catch-all carries the session verbs that do NOT have their own literal Gateway route: the reads (turns,
/// buffer-html, usage, context, github-urls, queue-read) and the writes (resize, clear-context,
/// history-picker, mobile-mode, voice-mode, wingman-enabled, relink, execute-action, and the voice queue's
/// add/update/remove/move/clear/send). The verb's request DTO and core are the SAME the Director REST route
/// used (Phase 0), so the reply body is identical; the Gateway only marshals method + path + body into the verb
/// payload and maps <see cref="DirectorCommandResult"/> back to the HTTP response.
///
/// Marshaling:
///  - reads and the no-body writes carry no payload (the target session is the command's SessionId);
///  - the body-shaped writes pass the raw request body straight through as PayloadJson (the REST route and the
///    tunnel verb share one DTO+core, so the bytes are identical);
///  - the queue path-parameterised verbs FOLD the {itemId} path segment into the payload (Architect note): the
///    request body (a JSON object or empty) gets an "itemId" field overlaid before it is sent.
