/// WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND HOW IT AVOIDS RE-MODELLING THE MATCHER.
///
/// A previous version of this file tried to detect whether two route patterns would TIE in the matcher, by
/// comparing a hand-rolled "shape key" and then only ever testing that key for EQUALITY. It was wrong, and
/// it was wrong in the way that matters: three independent route pairs escaped it and returned HTTP 500 at
/// request time - a standard parameter against an optional one on a present segment, literal case variants,
/// and equal-precedence complex segments differing only by their separator character. Equal keys are a
/// SOUND witness of a tie, but they are not the ONLY tie: two patterns can tie with DIFFERENT keys, and the
/// method-removal this primitive performs is exactly what manufactures those different-key ties.
///
/// The lesson from that miss is kept, because it is the second time this primitive made the same mistake:
/// <b>the matcher's FULL ambiguity relation is not reachable from public API, so any hand-written check for
/// the WHOLE of it is a MODEL of framework semantics rather than the semantics themselves.</b> The first
/// instance was a hand-written scan standing in for the route parser; the second was a hand-rolled key
/// standing in for the matcher. Both were correct on the cases their author thought of and wrong on cases
/// the framework already knew about.
///
/// So this does NOT reimplement the ambiguity relation. It asks a strictly smaller, DECIDABLE question -
/// "could a single request path be matched by both of these patterns at EQUAL precedence?" - and it answers
/// the precedence half by DELEGATING to the framework's own <see cref="RoutePrecedence"/>
/// rather than by re-deriving precedence digits. That is the opposite of modelling: the specificity ranking
/// that decides which of two matches wins is the framework's, computed by the framework. What is left for
/// this file to decide is only whether a common concrete path EXISTS, which is structural and conservative:
///
///   - Two patterns of DIFFERENT segment count, or of DIFFERENT inbound precedence, cannot tie - a
///     more-specific match always wins, so a literal never ties with the parameter that could cover it, and
///     a constrained parameter never ties with an unconstrained one. These are dropped.
///   - At EQUAL precedence, a position where BOTH sides are a single literal shares a path only if the two
///     literals are equal (case-insensitively, as the matcher compares them); unequal literals mean no
///     shared path and no tie. Every other position - a parameter, a catch-all, a complex segment - is
///     treated as ABLE to share a value (a parameter matches anything; two complex segments differing only
///     by separator still share values such as "a-b.c"). That is the fail-CLOSED direction: it can
///     over-reject an ambiguous DEVELOPER DECLARATION at startup with a clear error, which is acceptable
///     because it runs on the denied-route declarations, never on user traffic.
///
/// This is COMPLETE for the ties method-removal introduces. Two routes a family held apart by HTTP METHOD,
/// or two families denying one path under different verbs, become verb-less refusals with identical
/// precedence and intersecting value sets - Standard-vs-Optional, or separator-only complex differences
/// included - and every such pair fails the start, whether or not their old shape keys were equal.
///
///   - an EXCLUSIVE-PREFIX family maps ONE catch-all refusal under a prefix nothing else may serve, and
///     maps NO per-route refusal (the handle discards each handler). One refusal cannot tie with itself.
///     Exclusivity is checked by PREFIX CONTAINMENT against the finalised route patterns STRUCTURALLY - the
///     prefix is required to be literal at construction, and a live route's path is read from its parsed
///     segments, never from RawText, which a model-built pattern leaves null.
///
/// What this still does NOT claim to catch is a tie that would ALREADY exist in a family's own production
/// route table before any deny - an optional parameter against a shorter path under a DIFFERENT segment
/// count, say. That tie is not introduced by substitution; it is the family's own, it would surface off
/// hosted too, and deciding the general variable-length case is the unreachable relation. Deciding the
