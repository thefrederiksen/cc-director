/// documents that were rewritten in full on every counter move. Owns the connection, the schema, and the
/// schema version.
///
/// Why this exists at all (mission "SQLite on the Gateway", Phase 1). The JSON stores cost real money three
/// ways: every new question the owner asked cost a new dictionary, a new store field, and a deploy; a shape
/// change had no version to migrate from, so it either quarantined the file and lost the numbers (pull
/// request #1376 wiped the all-time concurrency peak this way) or, worse, deserialized to defaults and came
/// up silently with zeros; and a counter move rewrote the whole document on a request path. A narrow table
/// of rows answers a new question with a GROUP BY, PRAGMA user_version gives a real migration instead of
/// quarantine-and-lose, and a counter move costs work bounded by what changed rather than by how much
/// history is stored.
///
/// Schema versioning is the point, so it is here from day one. <see cref="SchemaVersion"/> is the version
/// this build understands; the file carries its own in PRAGMA user_version. An older file is migrated
/// forward inside a transaction. A NEWER file - written by a build that knows something this one does not -
/// is a LOUD failure, never a downgrade attempt: silently opening it is how a store loses data, which is the
/// exact failure this mission exists to end.

/// matching the house pattern already in Core (Communications/Services/DatabaseService.cs:47-60).

    // learn it from the response of whatever arbitrates. Two things follow, and both are additive.
    //
    //  1. THE previous_* COLUMNS on the three high-water tables. A writer used to compute a session's growth
    //     against its OWN in-memory mirror and append that growth to the shared delta ledger, while the stored
    //     watermark was arbitrated by the database. Those two cannot both be authoritative: two hosted
    //     containers each measuring growth from their own stale mirror append MORE in total than the watermark
    //     ever moved, so the all-time totals drift upward with every interleave. Now the raise statement parks
    //     the pre-raise value in these columns and returns it beside the new one, so a writer appends exactly
    //     the difference IT made. The sum of appended deltas equals the movement of the watermark by
    //     construction rather than by hope. Nothing reads them as a statistic.
    //
    //  2. A UNIQUE INDEX on each identity table's (tenant, display) pair. The database still never decides
    //     whether two DIFFERENT spellings are one identity - that is case-insensitive and stays in the
    //     aggregator's mirror. This forbids only the byte-for-byte duplicate, which is a duplicate under every
    //     comparer, and it exists so a mint can be an upsert that RETURNS the winning id instead of an insert
    //     that assumes it minted one. Creating it cannot fail on an existing self-host file: the mirror is
    //     loaded from these tables at startup and every insert goes through it, so one process could never have
    //     written the same spelling twice under one tenant, and the self-host store has only ever had one
    //     process.
    //
    // Both are ADD-only, so no table is rebuilt and no row is rewritten. A version 5 row's previous_* columns
    // land at zero, which reads as "this row has never been raised by a returning statement yet" - the first
