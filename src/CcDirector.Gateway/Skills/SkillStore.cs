/// The Gateway's persisted skill register - the central skill library (devthrottle_internal issue
/// 995). Skills live in the EF data layer (<c>skills</c> / <c>skill_versions</c> / <c>skill_files</c>):
/// the head row is identity and lifecycle, every piece of content is an immutable version row, and the
/// built-in set (<see cref="BuiltInSkills"/>) is written in by <see cref="BuiltInSkillSeeder"/> at
/// construction.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. Skills used to be copied onto every machine by the installer, so fixing one word
/// needed a release and every machine drifted the moment one was not re-installed - and only one agent
/// family ever saw them. Held here, a skill is written once and reachable by every agent on every
/// machine immediately. This register is an ADDITIONAL source of skills, not the only one: a machine's
/// own skills and a repository's own skills are untouched by all of this and take precedence on a name
/// clash. What the library adds is reach, not ownership.
///
/// THE SHARED LIBRARY. The built-ins are DevThrottle's: seeded once into the partition that is ambient
/// at CONSTRUCTION (the reserved System tenant on the hosted Gateway, Local on self-host) and served
/// READ-ONLY to every tenant from there. A tenant's register is the shared built-ins UNION the
/// tenant's own skills; id-scoped reads resolve the owning partition (the library always wins - it can
/// never be shadowed by a tenant skill, and creating a skill under a built-in id is refused). This is
/// the same deliberate cross-tenant read the workflow library makes: exactly one foreign partition,
/// built-in rows only, never written to on a request path - the ONLY writer of library content is the
/// boot-time seeder.

/// a fresh pooled context, preserving the single-writer invariant.
