/// <summary>
/// The Pi coding agent driver (@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). Pi's keyboard map
/// (per its README "Keyboard Shortcuts", live-verified in the Director QA) differs
/// from Claude in ways that make per-CLI drivers necessary:
///
///   - Escape       = cancel/abort the current turn (same keystroke as Claude)
///   - Ctrl+C       = CLEAR THE EDITOR (not an interrupt!)
///   - Ctrl+C twice = QUIT pi entirely
///   - Esc twice    = open pi's /tree session navigator (not a history rewind)
///   - /new         = start a fresh session (pi's context clear)
///
/// Therefore: <see cref="DriverCapabilities.Interrupt"/> is NOT declared - a naive
/// Ctrl+C cascade would kill the session, and pi has no safe hard-interrupt distinct
/// from quit. History is NOT declared - double-Esc opens a different feature.
/// Transcripts exist (~/.pi/agent/sessions/&lt;cwd-slug&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt;_&lt;id&gt;.jsonl) and the
/// conversation reader parses them, but the widget/usage readers below are not implemented, so
/// TranscriptRead stays undeclared. Launching remains with the Director's PiAgent, which passes
/// <c>--session-id</c> so the id - and therefore the file - is known from birth (issue #2670);
/// the records readers below resolve by that id.
