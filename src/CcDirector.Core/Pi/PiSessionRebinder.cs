/// <summary>
/// Follows a Pi session across pi's own <c>/new</c>. The Director names every Pi session's transcript by
/// launching pi with <c>--session-id</c>, so the file is known from birth (issue #2670) - except after a
/// context clear: <c>/new</c> starts a fresh session file under an id pi chose, and pi writes that file
/// only when the next message is sent, so the id cannot be learned at clear time (the synchronous wait in
/// <see cref="Session.ClearContextAsync"/> would sit out its whole minute and then fail a clear that had
/// worked). Instead <see cref="Session.ClearContextAsync"/> stamps <see cref="Session.ContextClearedUtc"/>,
/// and this watcher, at the session's next turn end - the first moment the new file can exist - looks for
/// a file in the session's repo CREATED after the clear under an id that is not the one just left, and
/// relinks the session to it through <see cref="SessionManager.RelinkClaudeSession"/>. From then on every
/// reader (the turn push, the context gauge, the model report, a later reopen) resolves the new file by
/// its id, and the turn push starts a new generation for it.
///
/// Turn-end-driven for the same reason <see cref="SessionRecordsWatcher"/> is: the scan reads pi's session
/// headers on disk, and a turn end is the one moment the answer can have changed. One instance per
/// Director, wired beside that watcher.
