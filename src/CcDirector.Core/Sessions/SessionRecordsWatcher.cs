/// <summary>
/// Keeps the session facts that live ONLY in the tool's own records fresh (issue #1637): the model the
/// agent is currently using (<see cref="Session.CurrentModel"/>) and its cumulative token spend
/// (<see cref="Session.TokenTotals"/>). Every time a session's turn ends (the detector flips it to
/// <see cref="ActivityState.WaitingForInput"/> - the same trigger <see cref="Storage.TurnReviewLogger"/>
/// uses), it reads both from the driver and stamps them on the session. The stamped values ride the
/// existing snapshot/delta path to the Gateway on <see cref="Gateway.Contracts.SessionDto.CurrentModel"/>
/// and <see cref="Gateway.Contracts.SessionDto.TokenTotals"/>, where the statistics fold consumes them.
///
/// The model and the tokens are the SAME QUESTION asked of the same records at the same moment - "what did
/// this turn just do" - so they are refreshed together, in one handler. The model that produced a turn and
/// the tokens it cost belong to each other; reading them at one turn-end keeps them consistent and keeps a
/// second, separate turn-end walk from existing.
///
/// Turn-end-driven ON PURPOSE, not read in the DTO mapper: these reads walk the agent's on-disk records
/// (transcript walk, rollout scan, SQLite query), and the mapper runs on every roster snapshot - exactly
/// the per-poll O(history) work the Gateway statistics mission calls out as the anti-pattern. A turn-end
/// read runs once per completed turn, off the detector's callback thread. It also stamps once at wire-up,
/// which answers immediately for resumed/restored sessions whose records already exist; a genuinely fresh
/// session honestly reports null for both until its first turn-end (records-only - see
/// <see cref="RefreshModel"/> for why the launch alias is never used).
///
/// The two facts are gated INDEPENDENTLY on their own capabilities: a driver is asked for the model only
/// if it declares <see cref="DriverCapabilities.ModelReport"/>, and for tokens only if it declares
/// <see cref="DriverCapabilities.TokenUsage"/>. Neither is ever asked with a NotSupportedException as
/// control flow - several drivers implement <see cref="IAgentDriver.ReadUsage"/> as a throw, so an ungated
/// token read would raise at every turn-end. A session whose driver declares neither is never wired at
/// all; both facts honestly stay null. One instance per Director.
