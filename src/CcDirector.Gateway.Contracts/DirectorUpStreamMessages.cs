/// Gateway Cleanup mission, Phase 0: the up-stream primitive. This is the ONE frame type that carries every
/// Director-to-Gateway byte stream over the tunnel - both the open-ended live terminal output AND a finite
/// file/screenshot byte read - keyed by <see cref="StreamId"/>.
///
/// The tunnel is the existing two-way SignalR channel (the Director dials the Gateway's DirectorHub and binds
/// its id with <see cref="DirectorStreamHello"/>). The Director is the SignalR CLIENT, so an up-stream is
/// native client-to-server streaming: the Gateway sends a unary "open" command carrying a fresh
/// <see cref="StreamId"/>, the Director starts a producer and streams these frames UP under that id via the
/// hub's StreamUp method until the Gateway sends a "close-stream" command (the load-bearing stop signal - see
/// the Architect ruling in docs/architecture/gateway-cleanup-phase0-tunnel-protocol.md) or the producer
/// reaches its end.
///
/// The browser-facing contract is UNCHANGED: the browser still opens the same WebSocket at
/// <c>/sessions/{sid}/stream</c> and the same GET for a file; the Gateway translates each frame back into the
/// browser wire form it always sent (a Size frame -> the {"type":"size"} json, a Binary frame -> a binary
/// WebSocket message or an HTTP body chunk, a Closed frame -> {"type":"closed"} then close).
