/// <summary>
/// TWO REAL PROCESSES AGREEING ON WHERE A SIGNAL LIVES - the test this mechanism shipped without, and
/// the reason a whole platform's lifecycle could be inert while every suite was green.
///
/// What the in-process tests in <see cref="LifecycleSignalTests"/> cannot see: a real signal always
/// crosses the launcher-Director boundary, and the two ends resolve storage differently. A Director
/// redirects <c>CC_DIRECTOR_ROOT</c> to its instance home at startup; the launcher never redirects.
/// When the Unix request-file path was derived from each process's own storage view, the Director
/// polled a directory the launcher never wrote - every stop became a 20-second stall and a force-kill,
/// and "install it now" reported success into a directory nobody watched. A single process cannot
/// reproduce that divergence honestly, so both ends here are child processes running the production
/// <see cref="LifecycleSignal"/> through a probe executable, each given exactly the environment its
/// production counterpart has. The parent test process mutates nothing of its own.
///
/// WHAT THIS PROVES PER PLATFORM - stated so nobody mistakes one platform's pass for the other's:
/// - On macOS and Linux these fail without the shared-root fix in
///   <see cref="LifecycleSignal.UnixRequestPath"/> and pass with it: they pin that both ends derive
///   the request-file path from the SHARED root, across the production redirect.
/// - On Windows the kernel delivers by NAME alone - no file path exists to agree on - so these cannot
///   detect a path regression there. They still prove genuine cross-process delivery through the
///   named event, which no other test does, but the path property is exercised on Unix ONLY. The
///   Windows-side detector for the path expression itself is
///   <see cref="LifecycleSignalRequestPathTests"/>, which asserts the derivation as a value and
///   therefore fails on every platform if the expression regresses.
