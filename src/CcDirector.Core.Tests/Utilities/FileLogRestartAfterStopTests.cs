/// FileLog.Stop() completes the writer's queue, which cannot be undone. FileLog.Start() then set the
/// _started flag back to 1 and started a thread on the SAME spent writer - restarting the flag and not
/// the writer. From that moment every FileLog.Write passed the "if (_started == 0) return" guard and
/// threw from Enqueue into whatever caller happened to be logging. The guard was correct code and saved
/// nothing, because _started had quietly stopped meaning "the writer can accept lines".
///
/// These tests live here rather than in the parallel Core.UnitTests assembly because they manipulate
/// FileLog's PROCESS-WIDE static state; this assembly serialises, so one test owns FileLog at a time.
/// The half of the fix that does not need static state - Enqueue never throwing - is tested in
/// Core.UnitTests, so it runs in the default gate.
