// FileLogWriter - the dequeue/rollover/flush engine behind FileLog. Regression tests for
// issue #171: a long-lived Director's log went silent after midnight (the new day's file
// was created at 0 bytes and never written). Three guarantees are pinned here:
//   1. Writes after a date rollover land in the NEW day's file.
//   2. A transient exception in the write path does NOT kill the writer thread.
//   3. Buffered output flushes within a bounded interval even while the queue stays busy.
// Each test uses an injectable clock so midnight can be crossed deterministically with no
// real waiting.
