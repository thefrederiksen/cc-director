/// The check answers "can a session I spawn actually reach the fleet?", so these tests drive it with
/// a stand-in tool whose exit code they control. That is the whole discriminator: the Director reads
/// the exit code and never asks the tool to judge itself.
///
/// Since the Remove-the-network-port mission the probe supplies the Gateway pair a real session gets
/// (CC_GATEWAY_URL + CC_GATEWAY_SESSION_KEY) rather than a Director address. The old "the tool said
/// there is no Gateway" classification is gone WITH ITS CAUSE: the probe always supplies both
/// variables now, so that answer cannot occur here - the no-Gateway verdict is reached upstream,
/// where the caller finds it has no credential to mint, before any tool is run.
///
/// A note on what the fixture can and cannot distinguish: a stand-in that exits 0 proves the PASS path
/// and nothing about authentication, because the fake never authenticates. What authentication failure
/// looks like from here is exactly what a non-zero exit looks like - which is why the real machine
/// proof is a live run recorded in the phase's QA evidence rather than simulated here.
