/// The ACTUAL report-session.ps1 (or report-session.sh) that <see cref="ClaudeHookInstaller"/> writes is
/// run with the two environment variables the Director stamps and fed Claude's raw hook event on stdin -
/// what Claude Code does at SessionStart on startup, resume, clear and compact. Then both halves are

/// picked the dropped pointer up and moved the session onto the rotated transcript.
