/// Issue #1879: <c>CC_DIRECTOR_ROOT</c> redirects where a Director WRITES but not where this migration
/// READS. It copies from fixed legacy paths, so every explicitly pinned root filled on first boot with
/// the machine owner's real accounts, repository list and session history - and that history carries
/// first-prompt snippets and turn summaries, i.e. real prompt text.
///
/// The part that made it more than untidy: <see cref="CcStorageMigration"/> copies whenever the
/// destination file is MISSING, and the migration runs on every process start. So deleting the copied
/// data did not stop it - the next start put it straight back. A root cleaned today refilled tomorrow,
/// silently.
///
/// These tests pin the guard. The predicate test states the rule; the behavioural test is the one that
/// matters, because it asserts on what a real migration run actually does to a pinned root rather than
/// on what the flag says it should do.
