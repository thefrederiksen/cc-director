/// <summary>
/// A NEW FACT WITH NO SIGNAL IS INVISIBLE, and defect 5's deliverable shipped that way.
///
/// The Gateway resolves a session's role and stamps it onto the owning Director. The fold reads the stamp
/// and correctly suppresses a controlled worker's red to "supporting". Both halves were right, and the
/// desktop rail still showed red - because nothing told it to re-read. The rail re-reads on activity,
/// status, hold, dictation, number and pending-deletion changes; a role arriving was none of those, so the
/// dot stayed red until some unrelated event happened to fire.
///
/// Every mapper test passed throughout, because they READ the fold, and reading is not rendering. That gap
/// - live consumer, correct producer, no notification between them - is this repository's signature
/// failure, and this mission added OnPendingDeletionChanged one commit earlier for exactly this reason.
///
/// So these pin the SIGNAL, not the value: does the fact announce itself, once, on real changes only.
/// Found by independent review of pull request 1598, not by the mission.
