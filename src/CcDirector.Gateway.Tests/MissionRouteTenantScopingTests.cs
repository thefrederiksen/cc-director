/// <summary>
/// devthrottle_internal issue #1039: the Gateway-native mission surface scoped to the CALLER's own tenant,
/// proven over the REAL mapped routes and the REAL auth middleware, with two separately-enrolled accounts.
///
/// What was live on the deployed hosted image: <c>GET /missions</c> called <c>missions.List()</c> - no
/// tenant argument at all - so two accounts created minutes apart, sharing nothing, were served
/// BYTE-IDENTICAL mission lists. A mission name is free text a person typed, so the payload disclosed
/// other customers' project and people names. <c>GET /missions/{mid}</c> resolved by bare id and
/// <c>POST /missions</c> wrote with no owner, which is how the shared store came to hold several accounts'
/// records in the first place.
///
/// HOW THESE CASES ARE WRITTEN, and it matters more than the count:
///
///  - The assertion is the INVARIANT - every record served to a caller belongs to that caller - not "this
///    particular id is absent". The #1017 matrix nearly missed this leak because its cross-tenant check
///    looked for a DEVICE ID inside the response, and a mission is not keyed by one, so it passed while the
///    box handed over the whole list. A check that knows only one kind of identifier certifies every
///    surface keyed by a different one.
///  - Every refusal is paired with a PERMITTED request in the same test. A Gateway that refused everybody
///    would satisfy every refusal assertion here while being completely broken, so a refusal on its own
///    proves nothing.
///  - <see cref="The_leak_detector_itself_detects_a_leak_when_there_is_one"/> is the SELF-TEST: it points
///    the same structural comparison these tests refuse with at a record the caller genuinely owns and
///    requires it to come out POSITIVE. If that ever goes green-by-absence, the detector cannot tell a
///    refusal from a success and none of the other cases mean anything.
///
/// Revert-prove: put <c>missions.List()</c> / <c>missions.Get(missionId)</c> back and
/// <see cref="A_missions_list_serves_only_the_callers_own_missions"/> and
/// <see cref="A_mission_belonging_to_another_tenant_is_not_resolvable_by_id"/> both go RED.
///
/// The assembly disables test parallelization, so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is reset in
/// DisposeAsync.
