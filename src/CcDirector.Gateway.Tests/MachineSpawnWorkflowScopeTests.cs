/// <summary>
/// Covers the tenant-scoped reads on POST /machines/{machine}/sessions: a spawn that names a workflow run or
/// a mission must be REFUSED cleanly when it does not exist, never fault.
///
/// WHAT THESE TESTS ACTUALLY PROVE, STATED NARROWLY BECAUSE A STRONGER CLAIM WAS INVESTIGATED AND DISPROVED.
/// <c>WorkflowRunStore.Get</c> and <c>.List</c> each open a context through
/// <c>GatewayDatabase.CreateContext</c>, which reads <c>ITenantContext.Current</c>; on hosted that is
/// <c>AsyncLocalTenantContext</c>, which THROWS by design when no scope is in effect. It was believed that
/// those reads ran outside any scope on this route and therefore answered 500 on hosted. They do not: on
/// hosted <c>GatewayHost</c> registers a middleware that resolves the request's tenant from the authenticated
/// device key and enters a scope around the WHOLE pipeline, so a device-key request arrives already scoped.
///
/// That was established by experiment rather than by reading: the route's own scope entry was moved back below
/// the reads and these tests still passed. So they are NOT a regression guard against an unscoped read - they
/// cannot fail that way - and they are not described as one. What they do hold is the behaviour a caller
/// depends on either way: an unknown run and an unknown mission are answered as bad requests, and a spawn that
/// names neither still fails for its own honest reason rather than being refused earlier.
///
/// A genuine guard for the unscoped-read theory would have to remove the middleware, not the route's line.
