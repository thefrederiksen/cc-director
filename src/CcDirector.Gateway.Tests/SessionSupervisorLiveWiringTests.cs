/// <summary>
/// Issue #915, THE WIRING PROOF. The engine tests beside this one prove the decision-making with a fake
/// environment; this one proves the thing a fake can never prove - that a REAL session, on a REAL Gateway,
/// crossing a REAL Working -> idle boundary, actually gets a "continue" typed into it over the tunnel.
///
/// Everything in the path is production code: the live <c>TurnEndWatcher</c>, the turn-end callback in
/// <c>GatewayHost</c>, the supervisor and its real <c>GatewaySupervisorEnvironment</c>, the pushed roster read,
/// and the tunnel verbs. The only stand-in is the Director at the far end, which answers the screen read with
/// the exact line from the 2026-07-21 incident and records what it is asked to do.
///
/// REVERT-PROOF: delete the <c>_sessionSupervisor?.OnTurnEnd(signal)</c> line from the turn-end callback in
/// GatewayHost and <see cref="AParkedSessionThatDiedOnAConnectionFault_IsSentContinueOverTheTunnel"/> goes RED -
/// no prompt verb ever reaches the Director. The engine tests would all still pass, which is exactly why this
/// test exists.
///
/// The tenant's first wait is turned down to the validated minimum (5 seconds) so the test costs seconds
/// instead of the shipped 45.
