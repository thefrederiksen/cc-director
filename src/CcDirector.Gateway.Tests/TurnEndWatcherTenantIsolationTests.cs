/// Hosted Multi-Tenancy (MTR-10 Gap C): the turn-end tracker's transition memory
/// (<c>TurnEndWatcher._lastActivity</c>) is keyed by (tenant, sessionId), NEVER the bare session id. Two
/// accounts can run sessions that happen to share an id; a bare-sid key let one tenant's last-seen state
/// suppress - or fabricate - the OTHER tenant's Working -> Waiting boundary, and so its voice auto-refresh.
///
/// This drives the REAL production path: two Directors on two DIFFERENT tenants over the real tunnel, each
/// authenticated with its own per-device key, and the live <c>TurnEndWatcher.Observe</c> transition wired
/// exactly as <see cref="GatewayHost"/> installs it (onTurnEnd -> voice refresh, resolving from the owning
/// tenant carried on the signal). Both tenants own a session with the SAME id, and both are marked voice
/// sessions, so a correctly-partitioned watcher fires an independent turn-end refresh for EACH tenant's own
/// Director.
///
/// REVERT-PROOF against the production keying: change <c>_lastActivity</c> back to a bare
/// <c>ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</c> keyed by session id alone and
/// <see cref="Same_sid_two_tenants_each_turn_end_reaches_only_its_own_director"/> goes RED - tenant B writing
/// "WaitingForInput" into the shared key first means tenant A's real Working -> Waiting transition sees no
/// change and its refresh is suppressed, so dir-A is never asked to read session "s".
///
/// The assembly runs sequentially (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is
/// reset in DisposeAsync.
