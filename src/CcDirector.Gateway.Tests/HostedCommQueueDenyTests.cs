/// <summary>
/// CR-6, comm-queue half: the /comm-queue surface must be REFUSED IN WHOLE on the hosted Gateway.
///
/// The store behind the route is ONE process-global SQLite file (config/comm-queue/communications.db)
/// with no tenant anywhere - not in the file, not in the store, not in the route - and the route sat
/// behind only the host-wide authentication gate, which admits ANY enrolled device key from ANY
/// account. So on shared hosted infrastructure every subscriber could read the operator's outbound
/// communications queue: draft emails, posts, recipients, personas. The Communication Manager app the
/// surface backed was retired 2026-07-06 and the comm queue is not part of the hosted launch, so the
/// family is refused on hosted rather than partitioned, through the shared refusal primitive
/// (<see cref="Gateway.Tenancy.HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup"/>) - the same boundary /vault/keys and
/// /shutdown adopted. On hosted the handler is NEVER MAPPED; one verb-less catch-all refusal claims
/// everything under /comm-queue, so every request shape - including a body-bound POST, a verb the
/// family never mapped, and a route added under the prefix later - meets the refusal.
///
/// This is the SOURCE-side half of the Wave-2 hostile two-tenant matrix's comm-queue row: the row
/// turns FAIL to PASS because an enrolled tenant's read is REFUSED, not because the route vanished -
/// the refusal is asserted as an exact payload, and the self-host control
/// (<see cref="SelfHostCommQueueControlTests"/>) proves the same route still serves the real queue
/// off hosted.
///
/// A REAL DRAFT IS SEEDED FIRST. A deny tested against an empty queue proves nothing - the refused
/// read here would otherwise have had nothing to disclose. The seed goes through the production
/// schema (<see cref="DatabaseService.InitializeAsync"/>) plus one raw insert, because the write API
/// died with the desktop app.
///
/// REVERT-PROOF - the recipe to RUN, not to describe. In
/// <c>src/CcDirector.Gateway/Api/CommQueueEndpoints.cs</c> change <c>Map</c> to map the route on the
/// ungrouped builder (<c>outer.MapGet("/comm-queue", ...)</c>) instead of through
/// <c>HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup</c>. Rebuild, confirm zero errors, run this class: every hosted
/// test reddens with the symptom - the enrolled tenant SERVED the operator's queue (200 with the
/// seeded draft) instead of the refusal - while <see cref="SelfHostCommQueueControlTests"/> stays
/// green. Restore, rebuild, rerun: all green.
///
/// Sets CC_DIRECTOR_ROOT (the storage root the handler resolves the SQLite path through) and
/// CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED, so it joins the DirectorRoot collection to serialize with every other test
/// that redirects the root.
