/// <summary>
/// Issue #2387: <c>POST /sessions/{sid}/mission</c> - attaching a session that ALREADY EXISTS to a Mission -
/// scoped to the CALLER's own tenant, proven over the REAL mapped route, the REAL auth middleware and the
/// REAL tunnel, with two separately-enrolled accounts.
///
/// WHY THIS ROUTE GETS ITS OWN PARTITION FILE. Missions are tenant-scoped and that was hard won:
/// devthrottle_internal issue #1039 fixed a live leak where <c>GET /missions</c> served every account's list
/// to every account, and a mission NAME is free text a person typed - customer names, project names, people's
/// names. The read side is now gated. This route is the first WRITE that takes a mission id from the caller
/// and applies it, so it is exactly the shape that would put the leak back: a caller who could attach a
/// session to another account's mission would be writing that account's identifier onto its own session, and
/// reading the name back out of its own roster. It follows <c>GET /missions/{mid}</c> line for line - resolve
/// the caller's tenant, refuse when unbound, resolve the mission INSIDE that tenant - and these cases hold it
/// to that.
///
/// HOW THESE CASES ARE WRITTEN, which matters more than the count:
///
///  - Every refusal is paired with a PERMITTED request in the same test, in the same Gateway. A route that
///    refused everybody would satisfy every refusal assertion here while being entirely broken, so a refusal
///    on its own proves nothing at all.
///  - A refusal is asserted at TWO levels: the status code, and the fact that the owning Director was never
///    sent an <c>attach-mission</c> command over the tunnel. A status code alone cannot tell "refused" from
///    "attached, then reported an error" - and it is the WRITE reaching the Director that would be the breach.
///  - <see cref="The_attach_detector_itself_detects_an_attach_when_there_is_one"/> is the SELF-TEST. Every
///    refusal below rests on "no attach-mission reached that Director". That assertion is worth exactly as
///    much as its ability to come out TRUE, so one case points the same recorder at an attach that genuinely
///    happens and requires a positive. If it ever goes green-by-absence, nothing else in this file means
///    anything.
///
/// Revert-prove: drop the <c>ResolveReadTenant</c> gate (or resolve the mission with <c>TenantId.Local</c>)
/// in the route and <see cref="Another_tenants_mission_cannot_be_attached_to_your_own_session"/> goes RED -
/// A's attach to B's mission stops being a 400 and reaches A's Director carrying B's mission name.
///
/// The assembly disables test parallelization, so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is reset in
/// DisposeAsync.
