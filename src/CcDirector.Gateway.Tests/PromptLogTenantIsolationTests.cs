/// Issue #1848: the prompt log is TENANT-SCOPED on the hosted Gateway, proven over real HTTP with two accounts.
///
/// This is the CONTENT-disclosure surface. Before this, <c>GET /prompts</c> did not take an HttpContext at all -
/// so it could not resolve a request tenant even in principle - and it answered fleet-globally: one account
/// read every other account's full prompt TEXT. This drives the REAL mapped endpoints through the REAL auth
/// middleware, exactly as SessionServingReadIsolationTests does for the cockpit read path.
///
/// THE PRODUCTION LINES THESE TESTS PROTECT (each revert-provable - revert it, watch these go red):
///   - <c>PromptEndpoints.ResolveTenant</c>, and the <c>store.Read(tenant.Value, ...)</c> /
///     <c>store.Append(tenant.Value, ...)</c> calls in the two /prompts handlers. Revert the resolution to a
///     fixed TenantId.Local and both accounts share one partition, so "B never sees A's text" goes RED and the
///     403 deny collapses to a 200.
///   - <c>GatewayPromptLog.DirectoryFor</c> - the ONE helper every read and write path goes through, which is
///     what makes the partition structural rather than conventional. Return the root directory for every
///     tenant and the same assertion goes RED.
///
/// The assembly runs sequentially (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is
/// reset in DisposeAsync.
