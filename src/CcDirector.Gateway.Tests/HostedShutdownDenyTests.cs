/// Production-readiness B2: POST /shutdown must be REFUSED on the hosted Gateway.
///
/// The route triggers a PROCESS-WIDE shutdown of the whole Gateway. On self-host that is correct - the single
/// owner's self-update helper POSTs it so the process exits and the exe unlocks. But on the HOSTED Gateway the
/// process is SHARED infrastructure serving every tenant, and the route was mapped with NO hosted refusal and
/// NO owner check - so ANY authenticated tenant's device key could POST /shutdown and take the Gateway down for
/// every other tenant at once. It is now refused on hosted through the shared refusal primitive
/// (<see cref="Gateway.Tenancy.HostedRouteDeny"/>), the same boundary #1904 adopted for /vault: on hosted a
/// verb-less refusal is mapped in place of the handler and the handler is never bound.
///
/// The proof observes REACHING THE HANDLER, not a status code alone: <see cref="GatewayHost.OnShutdownRequested"/>
/// is wired to a recorder that flips a flag WITHOUT tearing the host down, so a request that reaches the real
/// handler flips it and a request that meets the refusal does not. This is what makes "the shared Gateway was
/// not asked to shut down" a direct assertion.
///
/// Revert-prove: point the mapping back at the ungrouped builder (<c>app.MapPost("/shutdown", ...)</c>) and
/// <see cref="Hosted_shutdown_is_refused_and_the_handler_is_never_reached"/> goes RED - on hosted the handler
/// maps again, answers 200 { shuttingDown = true }, and the recorder flips.
///
/// Self-host is the control: <see cref="Selfhost_shutdown_still_reaches_the_handler"/> proves the deny is about
/// the hosted branch and not about /shutdown being broken - off hosted the shared token still drives a real
/// shutdown request through to the handler.
///
/// The assembly runs sequentially (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is reset
/// in the finally of each probe.
