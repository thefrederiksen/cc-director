/// <summary>
/// Issue #1019 - the card that nothing could remove. Three sessions were spawned, each call returned a
/// session id, and afterwards every tool denied they existed: the fleet listing and
/// `session done` / `interrupt` / `buffer` all reported no such session, while one card stayed on the
/// rail, frozen. Restarting the Director was the only remedy.
///
/// The mechanism is not a lost session - it is a roster that omitted rows the Director was still holding.
/// The fleet roster is what every cc-devthrottle verb resolves an id against BEFORE it sends anything, so
/// a row missing from that one list cannot be named, and a row that cannot be named cannot be reaped. The
/// original omission was a route-level filter that dropped ActivityState.Exited - and a CRASHED session
/// sits in exactly that state (a crash was never modelled as its own state, it lives on Session.Crashed)
/// while being deliberately KEPT in the roster and on the rail (issue #959).
///
/// Remove-the-network-port mission, phase 5: the Director's HTTP roster and /fleet/done routes are gone
/// with the listener, so these tests drive what replaced them - the SAME surfaces the CLI's calls ride
/// today. The roster a caller resolves against is the one the Director PUSHES up the tunnel, built row
/// by row through ControlEndpoints.Map (the host's SnapshotFullSessions does exactly this). The done
/// verb is SessionWriteExecutor's request-deletion, dispatched through the shared SessionCommandExecutor
/// the tunnel uses. The reap machinery on the other side was always willing; only the naming was
/// impossible. These tests prove the naming, then drive the real reap to completion.
