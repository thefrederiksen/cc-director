///
/// FIRST, THAT THE FAULT IS REAL. <see cref="TheSameFault_IsFatal_WhenItIsNotContained"/> runs the SAME
/// connection through the ordinary Entity Framework path with no boundary around it and watches it THROW.
/// Without that arm, every "the store reports unreachable" assertion below could pass against a store that
/// silently never attempted a connection at all - a test that has never been watched failing is decoration,
/// and this is the arm that makes the containment arm mean something.
///
/// SECOND, THAT THE TWO REASONS ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT. NOT CONFIGURED and UNREACHABLE are produced side by
/// side, in one test, and asserted to DIFFER from each other rather than each merely being non-empty. A
/// build that collapsed both into one generic "statistics unavailable" would satisfy every individual
/// assertion about either one; only comparing them can see it. That is the ruling: a deploy that simply
/// forgot a variable must not present identically to a database outage.
