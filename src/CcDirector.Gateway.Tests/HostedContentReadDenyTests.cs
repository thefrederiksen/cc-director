///
/// WHY A REFUSAL AND NOT AN EMPTY RESULT. An empty stats block, an empty record list or an empty
/// transcript is a FALSE statement about a box that is transcribing and capturing; a refusal is merely an
/// absent one.
///
/// THE GATE IS ON THE DEPLOYMENT SIGNAL. Every one reads <see cref="GatewayHostedMode.IsHosted"/> directly,
/// not an optional boundary or tenant argument. A security branch that depends on an optional argument
/// fails OPEN the moment a caller omits it.
///
/// REVERT-PROOF RECIPE (each family is denied through the shared refusal primitive
/// <c>HostedRouteDeny</c>, not a bespoke filter - the revert is RE-ENABLING THE REAL HANDLER ON HOSTED):
///   1. In the named file, change the family's routes so their real handlers map on hosted - e.g. replace
///      the <c>HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup</c> / <c>HostedRouteDeny.Group</c> call in <c>Map</c> with a
///      plain group that maps the handlers, OR flip the primitive's hosted branch so
///      <c>HostedDenyGroup.Map</c> maps the handler instead of the refusal.
///   2. Run this class. The theory cases for that family go RED - the real handler answers (a 200 payload,
///      a 400/401/404 from the handler's own body checks, or a startup failure when an exclusive family's
///      real route now serves under its own claimed prefix) instead of the exact refusal body - while every
///      other family stays green.
///   3. Run the self-host controls named below. They stay GREEN throughout - the deny is invisible to
///      self-host in both directions, which is the point.
///   4. Restore. Everything goes green again. (Proven for this branch: flipping the primitive's hosted
///      branch to map handlers reddened all four families' hosted theories - transcription, instructions
///      reads+writes, utterance, dictation - plus the unbound-caller and future-route probes; restoring
///      returned all green.)
/// The files and their deny call in <c>Map</c> are:
///   src/CcDirector.Gateway/Api/TranscriptionAnalysisEndpoint.cs   HostedRouteDeny.Group (per-route)
///   src/CcDirector.Gateway/Api/WingmanInstructionsEndpoint.cs     HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup
///   src/CcDirector.Gateway/Api/GatewayWingmanVoiceEndpoint.cs     HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup (utterance)
///   src/CcDirector.Gateway/Api/GatewayDictationEndpoint.cs        HostedRouteDeny.ExclusiveGroup
///
/// MUTATION-RED, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Removing the guard is only half the proof: it shows the
/// refusal is what produces the refusal. It does NOT show the test could notice the route going missing.
/// The Cockpit <c>MapFallback("{*path}")</c> answers ANY unclaimed path and verb - 404 in a Debug test
/// host, 200 with the HTML shell on a release host - and no 405 is ever raised here. So the second half of
/// the proof is to RENAME or RE-VERB each route and confirm the matching test goes RED. Both halves are
/// recorded in the pull request.
///
/// The assertions in THIS class survive that fallback by construction: each parses the body and requires
/// the property set to be exactly one <c>error</c> field with an exact message, so an HTML shell fails to
/// parse and any other JSON fails the property-set check. The receipts in the self-host class are what
/// needed rebuilding - they rested on a bare 200.
///
/// The SELF-HOST CONTROLS are <see cref="HostedContentReadSelfHostControlTests"/> in this file, plus the

/// every write asserts its own STORE RECEIPT - a state change read back - rather than a status code.
/// Neither catch-all can fake those.
///
/// These are still not change-detectors: what is pinned is the one value this test itself planted, or the
/// exact top-level property set of a handler whose payload is a stable contract, never an incidental
