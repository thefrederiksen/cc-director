/// The two account tenants these tests partition between, and - the point of this type existing at all -
/// the NON-CANONICAL SPELLINGS of one, WITH THE FIXTURE'S OWN PREMISE ASSERTED.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A TYPE AND NOT TWO CONSTANTS. The first version of these tests built an "uppercase alias" by
/// calling <c>ToUpperInvariant()</c> on an ALL-NUMERIC identifier. Uppercasing a string with no letters in
/// it changes nothing, so the alias was byte-for-byte the canonical value: the tests asserted that a
/// non-canonical spelling is refused while never once presenting a non-canonical spelling. They were not
/// weak tests - their premise never occurred, so they could not fail in the direction they were written to
/// catch, and they went red for the opposite reason. A fixture is a CLAIM ABOUT THE INPUT, and an unasserted
/// claim about the input is exactly as unreliable as an unasserted claim about the output.
///
/// TWO THINGS FIX IT, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE THAT LASTS. First, the identifiers now contain hexadecimal
/// LETTERS, so case actually varies. But choosing better characters is a fact about today's constants that
/// the next edit can quietly undo, so second - and this is the durable half - <see cref="AliasesOf"/>
/// ASSERTS ITS OWN PREMISE before returning: every spelling it hands back must differ from the canonical
/// value, and must still denote the SAME underlying identifier (otherwise the test would be presenting a
/// different tenant, which the store should refuse for an entirely different reason and would prove nothing
/// about spelling). If someone later changes these constants back to all-digit values, the fixture fails
/// LOUDLY at the claim rather than silently ceasing to test anything.
///
/// The alias set deliberately includes two forms that differ for ANY identifier - the dash-less "N" form and
/// the braced "B" form - so the premise no longer depends on the fixture happening to contain letters. That
/// is the design half of the same fix: make the condition impossible to miss rather than remembering to
/// choose inputs that hit it.

/// Every authenticated caller, on any tenant, saw every tenant's diagnostic history and could add to every
/// tenant's aggregate. There is NO caller-supplied identifier anywhere in this shape to namespace - the hour
/// comes from server time and the result carries no id - so the remedy is a PARTITION, not a prefix.
///
/// TWO HALVES, AND EITHER ALONE IS WORTH NOTHING. These tests deliberately prove the WRITE STAMP and the
/// READ FILTER separately, because a fix to one masks a hole in the other. A write-only fix still leaks on
/// the reads. A read-only filter is worse than it looks: it is a DEFERRED leak, because cross-tenant data
/// keeps accumulating behind it, so the day the filter is lifted or bypassed it exposes a contaminated
/// history that was written wrong all along. The store-level tests below state the write half directly
/// (does the record land in - and ONLY in - the writing tenant's partition), and the endpoint tests state
/// the read half through real authenticated HTTP.
///
/// OVERLAPPING TIME BUCKETS ARE THE POINT for the rollup, and they come for free: both tenants POST within
/// the same test, so the server-derived UTC hour is the SAME hour for both. That is exactly the collision
/// the census row describes - a shared aggregate that nobody can attribute afterwards, so a fold by one
/// tenant silently poisons the other's numbers.
///
/// A POSITIVE CONTROL ON EVERY CROSS-TENANT ASSERTION. Each "B cannot see A's data" assertion is paired with
/// "A CAN see A's data" on the same route in the same test. Without that pairing an empty answer passes for
/// isolation when what really happened is a failed seed - the strongest possible isolation result and the
/// weakest possible evidence, indistinguishable from the outside.
///
/// STATUS AND MEDIA TYPE ARE ASSERTED BEFORE ANY PARSE. Parsing is itself an assertion about format: a

/// JsonReaderException, which proves only that something upstream broke. An assertion says WHAT was served.
///
/// PRE-REGISTERED MUTATIONS AND PREDICTED REDS (one primitive per full-suite run, never combined - a
