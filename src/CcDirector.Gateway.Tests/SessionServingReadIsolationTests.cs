/// Hosted Multi-Tenancy (session-serving PR1): the cockpit READ path is tenant-aware end-to-end over real HTTP.
/// Two Directors connect on two DIFFERENT tenants, each authenticated with its OWN per-device key; the Gateway
/// resolves the request's tenant from that same authenticated key and serves ONLY that tenant's sessions:
///   - GET /sessions with device key A returns ONLY A's sessions, never B's;
///   - GET /sessions/{sid} for B's session, read with key A, is 404 (never located cross-tenant), while B's
///     own key reads it 200;
///   - a per-session tunnel leg (the WS-proxy screenshot list) for B's session, read with key A, is 503 (owner
///     not locatable under A's tenant), while B's own key reaches its Director over the tunnel;
///   - a request whose authenticated device key has NO bound tenant is DENIED 403 (deny-by-default), never
///     served the Local partition.
///
/// Revert-prove: change ResolveReadTenant (GatewayEndpoints) / ResolveTenantOrDeny (SessionWsProxyEndpoints)
/// back to TenantId.Local and key A reads the empty Local partition, so "A sees sess-a" and "A reaches its own
/// session" go RED (and the 403 deny collapses to an empty 200).
///
/// This drives the REAL mapped endpoints through the REAL auth middleware (which stashes the authenticated
/// device key) and the REAL tunnel Hello (which binds each Director's tenant) - it is the wired read path the
/// unit-level boundary tests (HostedTenancyActivationTests) do not exercise. The assembly runs sequentially
/// (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is reset in DisposeAsync.
