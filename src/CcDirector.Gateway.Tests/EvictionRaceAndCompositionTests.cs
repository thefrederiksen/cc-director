/// <summary>
/// Inspection 1, findings 1 and 5: the eviction cascade must not destroy a machine that is already back,
/// and the horizon the owner configures must be the one the SHIPPED Gateway uses.
///
/// WHY THESE ARE ONE FILE. Both are about the same gap between a decision and its consequences. The sweep
/// decides a machine is gone, and something then acts on that decision. Everything here is about that
/// interval, and about whether the thing being decided is even the thing the owner configured.
///
/// THAT GAP IS NOW CLOSED BY REMOVING THE WORK, NOT BY GUARDING IT. When this file was written the sweep
/// fed THREE destructive subscribers - releasing session numbers, forgetting the pushed cache, deleting
/// snoozes - and this summary described them in the present tense long after two were deleted. Today
/// exactly one thing acts on the decision, <c>PushedSessionStore.ForgetIfDisconnected</c>, and it is a
/// single atomic operation under the store's membership gate rather than a check followed by an act. The
/// other two are gone for good (inspection 2, finding 1), and
/// <see cref="EvictionLeavesSnoozesAndNumbersAlone_OnTheRealHost"/> below exists to redden if anyone
/// restores either one.
///
/// WHAT THE SEAM TEST DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. <see cref="DirectorRegistry.OnSweepJudgedForTest"/> fires
/// inside the exact window finding 1 describes, and a reconnect driven from it proves the ORDERING window
/// exists and is closed. It proves NOTHING about the concurrent race under real thread scheduling - no test
/// here starts a second thread or attempts to interleave one. Said plainly because the difference is easy to
/// lose: a passing seam test is evidence about sequence, not about concurrency.
