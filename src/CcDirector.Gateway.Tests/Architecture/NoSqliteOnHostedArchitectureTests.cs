/// <summary>
/// DT-SQL: the no-SQLite-on-hosted guard. The hosted Gateway must not keep a SQLite database.
///
/// WHY. On 2026-07-30 the hosted Gateway answered HTTP 500 to every client for 32 minutes: it keeps a SQLite
/// database on an Azure Files network share, a deploy ran two containers against that share, and the file was
/// corrupted. The remediation removes that database. THIS is what stops it coming back - the next hand that
/// adds an innocent-looking SQLite-backed store to the Gateway is stopped by a red test, not by somebody
/// remembering the incident.
///
/// WHY THE RULE IS STATIC RATHER THAN A STARTUP OR RUNTIME ASSERTION, which is the whole design decision here.
/// A runtime assertion - at startup, or inside a composed test host - only fires on a path that actually RUNS.
/// The thing being defended against is the store nobody has written yet, whose code will sit behind a lazy
/// initializer, a background sweep, or an endpoint no test calls. Such a guard passes GREEN for the exact
/// reason it should be red: nothing exercised the code that would open the connection. There is also no
/// supported process-wide interception point for <c>new SqliteConnection(...).Open()</c> - Microsoft.Data.Sqlite
/// exposes no global hook - so a runtime guard can only ever bind the sites that remember to CALL it, which is
/// precisely the "only checks the call site we already know about" weakness that makes a guard worth little.
/// A metadata scan has neither problem: it reads what the compiled assembly CAN do, so it does not care
/// whether any path ran, and it sees every site whether or not that site opted in.
///
/// AND THE POLARITY IS AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A DENYLIST. A denylist catches the call sites already known. An
/// allowlist catches every OTHER one - so a type nobody has written yet is caught by construction, because it
/// is not on the list. Adding a type to <see cref="SqliteTouchingTypes"/> is a deliberate, review-visible act
/// carrying a written reason, exactly as <c>TenantGateArchitectureTests.GlobalUnscopedTables</c> works for
/// un-scoped tables.
///
/// The rules:
///  - DT-SQL-1: no type in the hosted Gateway assemblies touches SQLite unless it is named on
///    <see cref="SqliteTouchingTypes"/>.
///  - DT-SQL-5: no exemption outlives its justification. Every allowlist entry carries a MACHINE-CHECKABLE
///    condition rather than only a reason, and the guard fails when a transitional one expires or a
///    structural one's property stops holding. A reason nobody checks is how a temporary accommodation
///    becomes a permanent hole.
///  - DT-SQL-2: every name on <see cref="SqliteTouchingTypes"/> still exists AND still touches SQLite, so the
///    allowlist cannot rot into ghosts that permit things nobody checked. It tightens itself: when the
///    remediation takes SQLite out of the statistics store, that entry goes RED and must be DELETED.
///  - DT-SQL-3: <see cref="HostedSqliteGuard"/>'s notion of "hosted" agrees with the provider
///    <see cref="GatewayDatabase"/> actually selects, across all three states of the variable.
///  - DT-SQL-4: <see cref="HostedSqliteGuard.EnsureNotHosted"/> refuses on hosted and names the path, and
///    does nothing on self-host.
///
/// SELF-HOST KEEPS SQLITE AND THAT IS CORRECT. The rule is no SQLite on the HOSTED Gateway. Nothing here
/// forbids the SQLite code from existing or from running on a desktop install.
///
/// This class joins the <c>GatewayHostedMode</c> collection under that collection's rule 1: DT-SQL-3 and
/// DT-SQL-4 SET a process-wide variable that decides whether a Gateway is hosted. The variable is
/// <c>CC_GATEWAY_DB_CONNECTION</c> rather than <c>CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED</c>, but the hazard is identical and
/// worse - anything constructing a GatewayDatabase in parallel would silently be handed the other test's
/// provider. The collection disables parallelization, which is what makes that impossible.
