/// <summary>
/// A MIGRATION THAT DIED PART-WAY THROUGH THE CHAIN, AND WHAT THE CONTAINMENT DOES ABOUT IT.
///
/// THE QUESTION THIS FILE EXISTS TO SETTLE. Ledger row 18 records a state nobody designed and everybody can
/// reach: a migration history table sitting there recording NOTHING as applied, next to tables this store
/// already owns. The chain reads an empty history, decides the baseline is pending, tries to create sixteen
/// tables that exist, and dies on the first one. The Architect kept that row OUT of Step 2 conditionally -
/// conditional on the containment being able to cover it. This file is that condition, discharged by running
/// rather than by reading the code and believing it.
///
/// WHAT THE CONTAINMENT CAN AND CANNOT DO, because the difference decides the row. It CANNOT prevent the
/// state: that state is made by a process that DIES mid-migration, and a try-catch catches nothing once the
/// process is gone. What it buys is that the NEXT startup over that state is survivable - the Gateway starts,
/// serves its roster, and says what is wrong with a reason that points at the right place.
///
/// WHY THE REASON IS ITS OWN NAME AND NOT "UNREACHABLE". This half-built store is REACHED perfectly well. The
/// database is up, the network is fine, the settings are right. Reporting it as unreachable would send the
/// first responder to check three healthy things, and the fault would be sitting on the store's own disk the
/// whole time. So INCOMPLETE SCHEMA is a distinct reason on the same grounds that NOT CONFIGURED and
/// UNREACHABLE are distinct: a named reason exists to separate causes that are FIXED IN DIFFERENT PLACES.
///
/// HOW THESE FIXTURES CAN FAIL, which is what makes a green here worth anything:
///
///  1. The half-built store is built by RUNNING THE REAL OLD CODE - a genuine GatewayStatsDatabase creates
///     the sixteen tables - and then adding the empty history table with ENTITY FRAMEWORK'S OWN create
///     script. Nothing here is a hand-written guess at what a broken store looks like; a fixture synthesised
///     from the new code's own understanding would be a guard supplying its own evidence.
///  2. <see cref="TheHalfBuiltStore_IsFatal_WhenItIsNotContained"/> runs that same file through the ordinary
///     migration path with nothing containing it and watches it THROW, naming the table. Without that arm
///     every assertion below could pass against a store that was never in a broken state at all.
///  3. <see cref="ContainedOpen_ChangesNothingOnDisk"/> seeds a row first. "It did not repair anything" is
///     otherwise indistinguishable from "there was nothing there to lose".
///  4. <see cref="TheThreeReasons_AreAllDifferentFromEachOther"/> produces all three states side by side and
///     asserts they differ PAIRWISE. Asserting each equals its own expected value would pass just as happily
///     against a build that had collapsed two of them, which is the exact defect the ruling exists to stop.
