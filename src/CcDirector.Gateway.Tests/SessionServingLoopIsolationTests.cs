/// Hosted Multi-Tenancy (session-serving PR2): the Gateway's BACKGROUND LOOPS are tenant-aware, and the ONE
/// down-channel lookup every command routes through resolves the tenant of the current unit of work instead
/// of a hard-coded <see cref="TenantId.Local"/>.
///
/// Two Directors connect on two DIFFERENT tenants over the real tunnel, each authenticated with its OWN
/// per-device key, exactly as <c>SessionServingReadIsolationTests</c> arranges the read path. This drives the
/// REAL production loop functions - <c>GatewayHost.SendCommandAsync</c> and <c>GatewayHost.SweepAutoDismiss</c>
/// (the auto-dismiss timer callback) - not a helper or a re-implementation.
///
/// Every absence claim here is preceded by a POSITIVE CONTROL in the same test: we first prove the command
/// DOES arrive for the tenant that owns the Director, then prove it does NOT arrive for the tenant that does
/// not. Without that ordering a total failure to deliver anything would satisfy every "did not arrive"
/// assertion and the test would pass vacuously.
///
/// REVERT-PROOFS (each guard independently, against the real production line):
///  - <c>GatewayHost.SendCommandAsync</c>: replace its <c>_tenantPass.Current</c> resolution with
///    <c>TenantId.Local</c> and <see cref="SendCommand_reaches_only_the_owning_tenants_director"/> goes RED on
///    its positive control - the Local partition holds no Director on hosted, so the same-tenant send that
///    must succeed returns null.
///  - <c>GatewayHost.SweepAutoDismiss</c>: replace its <c>_tenantPass.ForEachTenant(...)</c> with a single
///    direct call (the pre-PR2 implicit single pass) and
///    <see cref="AutoDismiss_sweep_runs_one_pass_per_tenant_and_closes_only_that_tenants_sessions"/> goes RED -
///    the unscoped pass reads no tenant's fleet, so neither session is closed.
///  - <c>AutoDismissSweeper.MarkKey</c>: drop the tenant prefix (back to a session-id-only close-mark) and
///    <see cref="AutoDismiss_close_marks_are_partitioned_per_tenant"/> goes RED - the second tenant's pass
///    finds the first tenant's mark and skips its own close.
///
/// The assembly runs sequentially (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is
/// reset in DisposeAsync.
