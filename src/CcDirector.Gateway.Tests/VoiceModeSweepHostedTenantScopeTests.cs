/// <summary>
/// The voice-mode sweep must actually SEND on the hosted Gateway (owner report, 2026-07-25).
///
/// The sweep is what makes voice mode a standing switch: the fan-out at POST /sessions/voice-mode/all reaches
/// the sessions alive at that instant, and the sweep carries the same intent to every session that appears
/// afterwards. On hosted it never switched a single session on. It decided correctly - it named the right
/// sessions every 15 seconds - and then threw every command away, because the DECIDING half ran inside the
/// per-tenant scope and the SENDING half ran after that scope had been left. <c>SendCommandAsync</c> resolves
/// a Director's stream within the tenant of the current unit of work and treats no-scope as a DENY, so each
/// command was dropped before it reached the tunnel and logged as an unreachable Director - for the whole
/// lifetime of the process, on a Director that was answering other verbs in the same millisecond.
///
/// The existing sweep proofs in <see cref="VoiceModeAllEndpointProofTests"/> could not catch this, and adding
/// more of them never would: they run SELF-HOST, where the ambient tenant is <c>TenantId.Local</c> whether a
/// scope was entered or not, so the missing scope has no effect there. Only a HOSTED Gateway can tell the two
/// apart. Hence this file boots one, with two tenants, and calls the sweep exactly as the timer does - from a
/// caller holding NO tenant scope of its own.
///
/// Revert-prove: move the send loop back outside <c>ITenantPass.ForEachTenantAsync</c> (plan inside a
/// synchronous <c>ForEachTenant</c>, act after it returns) and both tests below go RED - no voice-mode command
/// reaches either Director and neither session becomes a voice session.
///
/// The assembly runs sequentially (TestParallelization), so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is
/// reset in DisposeAsync.
