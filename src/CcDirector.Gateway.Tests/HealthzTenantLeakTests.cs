///
/// <c>/healthz</c> is deliberately PUBLIC - it is the unauthenticated liveness probe the Director's
/// connectivity self-test, the gateway endpoint selector, and the settings gateway test all dial - so it
/// carries no credential and therefore has NO TENANT. Its Directors/Sessions counts are fleet-GLOBAL
/// aggregates, so on a hosted Gateway an anonymous caller was reading a count over EVERY account's Directors.
/// That is not fixable by making the count tenant-aware: a request with no tenant has no correct number to
/// print. So on hosted the aggregate is not computed at all - deny-by-default applies to metrics too.
///
/// POSITIVE CONTROL / self-host-untouched: the same handler on a NON-hosted Gateway still reports the counts,
/// which is what proves the hosted assertion is about the tenancy branch and not about a Gateway that simply
/// has no Directors registered.
///
/// Revert-prove: delete the <c>tenantBoundary?.IsHosted == true</c> branch from the <c>/healthz</c> handler in
/// <c>GatewayEndpoints.Map</c> and <see cref="Hosted_healthz_reports_no_fleet_counts"/> goes RED - the hosted
/// probe reports the registered Director again.
