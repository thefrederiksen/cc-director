/// <summary>
/// PROOF ROW 10: THE GATEWAY STARTS AND SERVES A ROSTER WITH THE STATISTICS DATABASE UNREACHABLE.
///
/// This is the row the whole step is judged on. On 2026-07-30 the hosted Gateway answered HTTP 500 to every
/// client for thirty-two minutes because a statistics fault propagated out of the roster handler. Removing
/// SQLite from the hosted Gateway must not replace that with a NEW way for statistics to take the Gateway
/// down - and a statistics migration that ran inside the startup gate would be a worse version of it, since
/// the process would never bind its port at all and there would be no roster to serve.
///
/// WHAT MAKES THIS FIXTURE ABLE TO SHOW THE FAILURE, rather than merely able to pass. Three things, and
/// without them a green here would prove nothing:
///
///  1. The statistics connection points at a database that is genuinely NOT THERE, and the same connection
///     is proven to THROW when it is not contained -
///     <see cref="GatewayStatsStoreContainmentTests.TheSameFault_IsFatal_WhenItIsNotContained"/>. So a
///     Gateway that let the fault propagate would fail to construct, and this test would error rather than
///     pass.
///  2. The store is asserted to have ATTEMPTED the connection - reason UNREACHABLE, failure count one. A
///     Gateway that quietly skipped statistics entirely would report NOT CONFIGURED instead, and these
///     assertions would fail. "It started" is not the claim; "it started having tried and failed" is.
///  3. The roster response is asserted to be a real roster body, not merely a 200. A catch-all, an error
///     page or an empty body would all carry a 200.
///
/// PROOF ROW 15 rides in this file too, because it is the same fixture one assertion over: nothing writes
/// gateway-concurrency-stats.json on the hosted path. It has its own control - the identical run with the
/// hosted flag off DOES write that file - so the absence is a refusal rather than a path that was never
/// going to be taken in a test.
