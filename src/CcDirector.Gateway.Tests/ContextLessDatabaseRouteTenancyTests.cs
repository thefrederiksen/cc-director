/// <summary>
/// VERIFICATION, BY EXECUTION, of a claim about the hosted Gateway's context-less routes.
///
/// THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. A census found sixty-six routes that take a path parameter but no
/// <c>HttpContext</c>, and INFERRED that the database-backed ones must hit the deny-by-default throw in
/// <c>AsyncLocalTenantContext.Current</c> - broken, but not leaking - because a handler with no
/// <c>HttpContext</c> cannot resolve the caller's tenant. That inference had never been executed.
///
/// WHAT THIS FILE DOES. It seeds real rows for TWO tenants over real HTTP through the real auth middleware
/// on a real hosted <see cref="GatewayHost"/>, then has tenant A name tenant B's object id on context-less
/// database-backed routes, and records exactly what comes back.
///
/// SCOPE - READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING THE RESULT. This file CROSS-PROBES EIGHT of the sixty-six context-less
/// routes, across four stores: two work-list operations, two cron operations, one session-spend read, and
/// three workflow operations. A ninth context-less route, POST /gateway/workflows/{id}/publish, is exercised
/// on the OWNER path only, as a seed, and is NOT cross-probed - it is not part of the claim.
///
/// It does NOT retire the other fifty-eight by inference; that was the census's error and repeating it here
/// would be the same mistake in the opposite direction. The full code-derived inventory, and exactly what
/// remains unproven, is stated in the pull request. Eight samples cannot stand for sixty-six.
///
/// HOW A POSITIVE CONTROL IS BUILT HERE. Asserting a status code does not prove the intended handler
/// returned the seeded row - an unrelated 200, a catch-all, or a failed seed answering empty would all pass.
/// So every owner control asserts the exact SEEDED FINGERPRINT (the values this test itself wrote), and
/// every write or delete is judged by an independent RE-READ of the resulting state, never by the absence of
/// a substring. Status and media type are asserted BEFORE any parse, because parsing is itself an assertion
/// about format: parse-first would turn a wrong response into a parser crash, which proves nothing.
///
/// WHAT EXECUTION FOUND. Nothing threw and nothing leaked. Every route answered its owner with the exact
/// seeded row and answered the other tenant with an ordinary not-found; tenant B's rows survived tenant A's
/// delete attempts byte-for-byte, and tenant B could then perform those same deletes itself - so the refusals
/// are refusals, not inert operations. The claim's conclusion about the database half is wrong in BOTH
/// halves: these routes are neither broken nor leaking.
///
/// THE MECHANISM, AND WHY IT IS PROVEN ELSEWHERE. The tenant scope is not entered by the handler, so a
/// handler's signature cannot decide whether one exists. It is entered by a host-wide middleware registered
/// before routing that binds the AUTHENTICATED device key's tenant for the whole pipeline
/// (<c>GatewayHost.cs</c>, the device-key HTTP boundary). A context-less handler therefore runs inside the
/// caller's scope, and the entity global query filter answers about the caller's tenant only.
///
/// Those are TWO SEPARATE production mechanisms, and an end-to-end test like this one cannot tell them
/// apart - it would pass if either did all the work. They are therefore isolated from each other, without
/// HTTP and without the middleware, in <see cref="ContextLessRouteTenancyMechanismProofTests"/>, which is
/// the companion to this file and is where the causal claims are actually earned.
