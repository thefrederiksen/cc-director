/// <summary>
/// REFUSED AND UNMODIFIED ARE TWO CLAIMS, AND THIS FILE ASSERTS THE SECOND ONE.
///
/// A guard that rejects an input has two obligations: to DECLINE it, and to LEAVE IT UNTOUCHED. Almost every
/// test written for such a guard asserts only the first, and that is not a hypothetical worry here - the
/// adoption step once certified a FOREIGN database as fresh and then wrote sixteen statistics tables and a
/// baseline row INTO IT. The harm was the SIDE EFFECT and not the verdict, and a test asserting only that it
/// said no would have passed throughout.
///
/// WHAT THIS FILE ADDS THAT THE ADOPTION TESTS DO NOT. Those drive <c>GatewayStatsSqliteAdoption.Adopt</c>
/// DIRECTLY. The real startup path is <see cref="GatewayStatsStore"/>, which does strictly more before and
/// after that call: it builds a provider, creates the storage directory, opens a POOLED connection, runs the
/// adoption step, and then disposes the provider on refusal. Every one of those is an opportunity to touch a
/// file that the direct tests cannot see, so the whole path is exercised here and the store is measured
/// before and after.
///
/// WHAT MAKES THESE FIXTURES ABLE TO SHOW THE FAILURE:
///
///  1. Both stores are built by RUNNING REAL CODE or by writing a real database - never by describing what
///     one is believed to look like.
///  2. Each asserts its OWN PREMISE before the refusal: the foreign table is really there, the version stamp
///     is really the one being rejected. A store that had never contained the thing cannot demonstrate that
///     the thing survived.
///  3. The survival assertions are POSITIVE about what must remain and NEGATIVE about what must not appear.
///     Checking only "no migration history table" would pass against a refusal that dropped every table the
///     operator owned - which is the more destructive failure of the two.
