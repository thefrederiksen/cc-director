/// <summary>
/// The clean-machine install failure, at the seam it happened on (devthrottle_internal issue #1050).
///
/// On the first clean-machine walk of v1.8.7 the product could not start a session with the agent its
/// OWN wizard had just installed. The wizard runs the official installer, which drops the binary in
/// <c>~/.local\bin</c>; detection probes that location directly, so the wizard finds it and records
/// its ABSOLUTE path on the agent entry (<c>agent.entries[].executable_path</c>) and reports
/// "1 agent ready". But nothing writes the legacy per-type <c>agent.claude_path</c> key any more, so
/// <see cref="AgentOptions.ClaudePath"/> stays at its bare default "claude" - and the Control API
/// create path built the agent from <see cref="AgentOptions"/> alone. So the ARGUMENTS came from the
/// entry and the EXECUTABLE came from somewhere else: CreateProcess was handed a bare "claude" that
/// resolves on no clean machine, and the session died with "CreateProcess failed."
///
/// Every existing test passed because every test exercised the working seam - the desktop New Session
/// dialog passes the selected entry's path explicitly, which is every path a developer takes.
///
/// THIS TEST PINS THE PROPERTY, NOT THE SYMPTOM. It asserts the RESOLVED EXECUTABLE the create path
/// launched, and the expected value is a file inside the test's own temp folder, so no machine's PATH
/// can make it pass by accident - which is exactly how "the session starts" would go green again the
/// moment something put <c>.local\bin</c> on a PATH, while a clean machine stayed broken.
///
/// CC_DIRECTOR_ROOT is redirected to an isolated temp folder, so the seeded config, the agent entry
/// and the Claude hook-settings file never touch the real machine. In the "DirectorRoot" collection,
/// which serializes root-touching tests.
