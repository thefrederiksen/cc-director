/// THE STANDARD, BOTH HALVES AT ONCE: a subscriber may drive EVERY machine registered to their own account,
/// and may NEVER reach one registered to another. On the launcher command stream specifically, which is the
/// only arm that can reach a launcher on a hosted Gateway.
///
/// WHAT THIS REPLACED. The hub used to be DENIED on hosted - not mapped at all - and the file this replaces
/// asserted that refusal. The deny was correct when it was written: LauncherHub.Hello resolved no tenant, and
/// LauncherConnectionRegistry keyed one active connection per BARE MACHINE NAME, so a launcher saying Hello
/// for machine X overwrote the row for machine X whoever owned it. One subscriber could supersede another's
/// active connection by claiming the same name, and then receive the commands meant for it.
///
/// Both of those conditions are now false. Hello resolves the tenant from the authenticated device key and
/// aborts when it resolves to none; the registry keys on (TenantId, Machine). So the assertions move from
/// "nobody may join" to "its owner may, and nobody else can see or displace them" - which is a strictly
/// stronger statement, because a hub that refuses everyone identically cannot demonstrate isolation at all.
/// It can only demonstrate absence.
///
/// WHY THE COST OF THE DENY WAS TOTAL RATHER THAN PARTIAL, which is what made replacing it urgent rather than
/// tidy: on hosted the stream is the ONLY arm that reaches a launcher. The REST fallback dials the launcher's
/// registered address, and LauncherHost binds Kestrel to loopback only, so from a hosted Gateway that arm
/// cannot connect to a remote machine at all. With the hub unmapped a subscriber's launcher registered fine,
/// heartbeated fine, listed fine - and could never receive one command.
///
/// EVERY CROSS-TENANT PROOF HERE OBSERVES THE ACT, NOT ONLY A STATUS CODE. Each launcher records the commands
/// it actually receives, so "Bob did not reach Alice's machine" is asserted against Alice's launcher having
/// received nothing - and the same-tenant tests are the control proving that instrument fires at all.
