/// <summary>
/// CR-6, missions half - the WIRING proof that completes <see cref="MissionRouteTenantScopingTests"/>.
///
/// That class proves the per-request partition over the mapped routes: list, resolve-by-id, create
/// ownership, and the parent reference, each refusal paired with a permitted control. This class proves
/// the three properties those tests cannot see:
///
///  1. QUARANTINE ON HOSTED (Architect ruling: quarantine on hosted, adopt-as-Local on self-host,
///     nothing deleted). The hosted <see cref="GatewayHost"/> must construct its mission store with
///     <c>adoptUnattributedAs: null</c>, so a row written before missions carried an owner matches NO
///     tenant: never listed, never resolvable, never deletable - and still on disk afterwards. This is
///     proven through the REAL host construction (GatewayHost.cs decides from GatewayHostedMode.IsHosted),
///     not by constructing a store with the right argument in the test, which would prove only that the
///     store honors an argument nobody is proven to pass.
///  2. THE DELETE LEG of the exit row "tenant A cannot list, resolve, or delete tenant B's missions".
///     No HTTP delete route exists on the Gateway (MissionStore.Delete has no production route), so the
///     surface a future route would go through is the store seam the existing routes already use -
///     <see cref="GatewayHost.Missions"/> - and the property is proven there, with a destructibility
///     control proving the same operation IS capable of deleting when the owner runs it.
///  3. THE COMM-QUEUE ROW in the same two-tenant setting: with two enrolled tenants standing, neither
///     can read the operator's comm queue - the refusal is the exact
///     <see cref="Api.CommQueueEndpoints.RefusalMessage"/> payload, not a vanished route (the self-host
///     control for that family is <see cref="SelfHostCommQueueControlTests"/>).
///
/// The mirror half of the quarantine is <see cref="SelfHostMissionAdoptionControlTests"/>: the SAME
/// seeded file, hosted mode off, and the legacy row is the single owner's - listed and resolvable. One
/// direction alone cannot tell quarantine from a store that lost the row.
///
/// Revert-prove (the negative control the phase report records): in GatewayHost.cs change the store
/// construction to the pre-#1039 single-tenant shape - <c>adoptUnattributedAs: Core.Tenancy.TenantId.Local</c>
/// unconditionally - and the quarantine tests here go RED (the legacy row surfaces to nobody's benefit:
/// it is Local's, and Local is exactly the shared partition hosted must never serve). Feed the mission
/// routes a constant tenant instead of the caller's and MissionRouteTenantScopingTests reddens. Map the
/// comm-queue on the ungrouped builder and the comm-queue row here reddens with a 200.
///
/// The assembly disables test parallelization, so toggling CC_GATEWAY_HOSTED here is safe; it is reset
/// in DisposeAsync.
