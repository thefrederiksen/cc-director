# Read GitHub Issues

Browse, filter, and select GitHub issues, then download all content and images so an agent can fully understand and work on the selected issue.

## Input: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### Step 1: List Issues

If a specific issue number is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip to Step 2.

If a search query or label filter is provided, use it:
```bash
# By label
gh issue list --label "bug" --state open

# By search
gh issue list --search "QUERY" --state open

# All open issues
gh issue list --state open --limit 30
```

If no filter is provided, list all open issues:
```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 30
```

Display the issues in a clear format showing:
- Issue number
- Title
- Labels
- Assignee
- Created date

### Step 2: Select an Issue

- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a specific issue number, use that directly
- Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion to let the user pick which issue to work on
- Present the top issues as options with their titles

### Step 3: Download Full Issue Content

Once an issue is selected, fetch everything:

```bash
# Get full issue details including body
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER

# Get all comments
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --comments

# Get issue metadata as JSON for structured parsing
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,labels,assignees,comments,state,milestone,createdAt,updatedAt,author
```

### Step 4: Extract and Download Images

1. Parse the issue body and all comments for image URLs
2. Look for patterns like:
   - `![alt](https://...)`  — Markdown images
   - `https://github.com/user-attachments/...` — GitHub uploaded images
   - `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...` — Legacy GitHub images
3. For each image found:
   - Download it to a temporary location using `curl` or `Invoke-WebRequest`
   - Save to a temp directory like `$env:TEMP/gh-issues/ISSUE_NUMBER/`
   - Read the image using the Read tool so Claude can see it
4. If no images are found, note that and continue

### Step 5: Present Complete Issue Context

Provide a comprehensive summary including:

```markdown
## Issue #NUMBER: TITLE

**State:** open/closed
**Labels:** label1, label2
**Assignee:** @username
**Created:** date
**Author:** @username

### Description
[Full issue body]

### Images
[Display all downloaded images]

### Comments (N total)
[All comments with authors and dates]

### Key Requirements
- [Extracted actionable items from the description]
- [Any acceptance criteria mentioned]

### Related Files (if mentioned)
- [Any file paths or code references from the issue]
```

### Step 6: Offer Next Steps

After presenting the issue, ask the user:
- Would you like to implement this issue? (suggest using `/implement-issue NUMBER`)
- Would you like to assign it to yourself?
- Would you like to add a comment?

## Important Notes
- Always use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations
- Download images so Claude can actually see and understand visual bug reports
- Parse both the issue body AND all comments for complete context
- If the repo has many issues, default to showing only open ones
