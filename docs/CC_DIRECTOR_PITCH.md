# CC Director - Product Overview & Go-To-Market Brainstorm

**Purpose:** Brainstorming document for developers and marketers to discuss how to position, promote, and grow CC Director as an open source tool.

---

## What is CC Director?

**CC Director** is a Windows desktop application that lets developers run and manage multiple [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions simultaneously from a single unified interface.

**The One-Liner:**
> "Mission Control for your AI coding assistants"

**The Problem It Solves:**
When working with Claude Code, developers often need to:
- Work on multiple repositories at once
- Monitor what Claude is doing across projects
- Switch context between different coding tasks
- Keep track of which AI session is waiting for input vs. actively working

Without CC Director, this means juggling multiple terminal windows, losing track of which Claude session is doing what, and constantly switching contexts.

**The Solution:**
CC Director provides a unified dashboard where you can:
- Launch multiple Claude Code sessions (one per repo)
- See at a glance what each session is doing (color-coded status)
- Switch between sessions instantly
- Send prompts to any session from a dedicated input bar
- Persist sessions across app restarts

---

## Core Features & Benefits

### 1. Multi-Session Management

**What it does:**
- Run multiple Claude Code instances side-by-side
- Each session works on its own repository
- Drag-and-drop to reorder sessions
- Name and color-code sessions for easy identification

**The benefit:**
> "Work on your frontend, backend, and infrastructure repos simultaneously - each with its own Claude assistant - without losing track."

**Demo scenario:**
Show a developer with 4 sessions open: React frontend, Node API, Python ML service, Terraform infra. Each has a custom name. They switch between them instantly.

---

### 2. Real-Time Activity Tracking

**What it does:**
- Color-coded status indicators for each session:
  - **Green (Idle)** - Claude finished, waiting for next task
  - **Blue (Working)** - Claude is actively processing
  - **Amber (Waiting for Input)** - Claude asked a question
  - **Red (Waiting for Permission)** - Claude needs permission to proceed
  - **Gray (Exited)** - Session ended

**The benefit:**
> "Know instantly which of your AI assistants needs attention without checking each terminal."

**Demo scenario:**
Show 3 sessions - one green (done), one blue (working), one amber (asking a question). User sees the amber one needs their input and clicks to respond.

---

### 3. Embedded Console

**What it does:**
- Full native Windows console embedded in the app
- Not an emulator - real terminal with full Claude Code features
- Dedicated prompt input bar at the bottom (Ctrl+Enter to submit)

**The benefit:**
> "You're not giving up any Claude Code functionality - it's the real terminal, just organized better."

**Demo scenario:**
Show Claude Code running with full color output, using tools, scrolling history - all inside the CC Director window.

---

### 4. Session Persistence

**What it does:**
- Sessions survive app restarts
- Automatic reconnection to running Claude processes
- "Reconnect" button finds orphaned sessions
- Sessions remember custom names and colors

**The benefit:**
> "Reboot your machine, restart the app - your AI assistants are right where you left them."

**Demo scenario:**
Close CC Director, reopen it, sessions restore automatically with the same state.

---

### 5. Git Integration

**What it does:**
- Source Control tab shows staged/unstaged changes
- Current branch with ahead/behind status
- Click to open files in VS Code
- Repositories tab for managing repos

**The benefit:**
> "See what files Claude has changed before committing - without leaving the app."

**Demo scenario:**
After Claude makes changes, show the Source Control tab with modified files highlighted.

---

### 6. Hook System (Under the Hood)

**What it does:**
- Integrates with Claude Code's hook system
- Captures 12+ event types (tool use, prompts, notifications, etc.)
- Powers the real-time status indicators
- Uses Windows Named Pipes for fast, async IPC

**The benefit (for developers):**
> "Built on Claude Code's official hooks API - not a hack. Extensible and maintainable."

---

### 7. Voice Mode (New)

**What it does:**
- Talk to Claude using your microphone
- Speech-to-text transcription (local or cloud)
- Claude's response is summarized and spoken back
- Hands-free coding assistance

**The benefit:**
> "Dictate your coding tasks while your hands are on the keyboard - or step back and talk through a problem."

**Demo scenario:**
User says "Add a logout button to the header" - Claude receives the text, works on it, and the response is read aloud.

---

### 8. Teams Remote Control (Coming Soon)

**What it does:**
- Control CC Director from your phone via Microsoft Teams
- Commands: `/ls` (list sessions), `/s` (select), `/new` (create), `/snap` (screenshot + text), `/kill` (terminate)
- Send prompts to Claude by just typing in Teams chat
- Smart notifications when Claude finishes a task

**The benefit:**
> "Step away from your desk but stay connected. Check on Claude's progress from your phone, send new tasks, see screenshots of the terminal."

**Demo scenario:**
Show Teams on a phone:
1. User types `/ls` - sees list of sessions
2. User types `/s react-app` - selects that session
3. User types "Add dark mode support" - Claude receives the prompt
4. User gets notification when done
5. User types `/snap` - sees screenshot of terminal

## Positioning & Messaging

### Positioning Statement

> For professional developers who use Claude Code daily, CC Director is a session management tool that lets you run multiple AI assistants simultaneously without losing track. Unlike juggling terminal windows, CC Director provides real-time visibility into what each Claude session is doing.

### Key Messages

1. **Multiplicity:** "Run 5 Claude sessions at once, see all their statuses at a glance"

2. **Visibility:** "Never wonder 'is Claude done yet?' - the status indicator tells you"

3. **Persistence:** "Sessions survive restarts - Claude remembers where you left off"

4. **Professional:** "Built for developers who use Claude Code as a core part of their workflow"

### What CC Director is NOT

- Not a Claude Code replacement (it runs Claude Code)
- Not a terminal emulator (it embeds real terminals)
- Not a cloud service (it's a local desktop app)
- Not an AI itself (it manages AI sessions)

## Discussion Questions for the Team

1. **Naming:** Is "CC Director" the right name? Alternatives:
   - Claude Control
   - Session Director
   - AI Mission Control
   - Claude Dashboard
   - (Something catchier?)

2. **Target platform:** Windows-only for now. When/if to support Mac/Linux?

3. **Pricing model:** Open source and free? Freemium with enterprise features? Donations?

4. **Teams integration:** Ship it in v1 or hold for v2?

5. **Voice mode:** Local (Whisper) vs cloud (OpenAI) - which to default?

6. **Branding:** Do we need a logo? Visual identity?

7. **Demo environment:** Should we create a demo repo for the videos?

8. **Telemetry:** Add opt-in usage analytics? Privacy concerns?

9. **Documentation:** How much is enough for launch?

10. **Partnerships:** Reach out to Anthropic? Claude Code team?
