// There are TWO different sign-ins in this product and they are easy to conflate:
//
//   1. the PERSON signs in at devthrottle.com (this is what the Sign in button does), and
//   2. the GATEWAY signs in to a DevThrottle account (without this it has no account to enroll onto).
//
// A device cannot enroll until BOTH have happened, and a fresh install has only ever done (1). The
// Gateway reports that as 409 from POST /m/enroll. Before this existed, the callback screen treated it
// as a generic error and offered only "Try again" - which returns to the sign-in screen and fails again
// for exactly the same reason, a loop with no exit. So 409 must stay distinguishable from every other
// enrollment failure, or that dead end comes straight back.
//
// Note this is the pure classification only. client-core has no DOM test tooling (no jsdom, no
// testing-library), so the screen that consumes it is not rendered here.

// The two enrollment requests (multi-tenant hosted sign-in, Phase C). The client forwards whichever
// credential the website returned in the callback fragment, and the two gateway kinds authenticate the
// mint differently:
//   - SELF-HOST (enrollDevice): the device_key travels in the request BODY, no Authorization header.
//     This is the pre-hosted behavior and must stay byte-for-byte identical, or every self-hosted
//     install's sign-in breaks.
//   - HOSTED (enrollDeviceHosted): the account access token travels as `Authorization: Bearer` and NO
//     device_key is put in the body (tenant isolation is bound at the mint from the verified token).
// Both read the local device key back from the response identically; only the request differs.
