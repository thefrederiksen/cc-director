// The enrollment call (issue #908, shared by the desktop Cockpit since issue #1088): hand the Gateway
// the credential this device received from devthrottle.com, and receive back the LOCAL device key the
// Gateway issues and validates offline. This is the only place the cloud-issued credential is used;
// from then on the app authenticates with the local key returned here. POST /mobile/enroll is under
// /mobile/, so it is reachable before the device holds any credential (the Gateway also keeps the old
// POST /m/enroll mapped, so an installed PWA still mid-flight on the previous bundle keeps working).
// Both shells enroll through this ONE generalized endpoint - the platform field tells the Gateway what
// kind of device this is (android/ios -> phone, anything else, for example "browser" -> browser).
//
// There are TWO enrollment credentials, one per gateway kind, and the client forwards whichever the
// website returned in the callback fragment (multi-tenant hosted sign-in, Phase C):
//   - SELF-HOST gateway: an account-scoped device_key carried in the request BODY (enrollDevice), the
//     pre-hosted behavior that must not regress.
//   - HOSTED gateway: the person's short-lived Supabase access token, carried as an
//     `Authorization: Bearer` header (enrollDeviceHosted). The hosted mint reads the account subject
//     from that verified token, checks the paid entitlement, resolves the tenant, and mints a
//     tenant-scoped device key. No device_key is sent in the hosted body.
