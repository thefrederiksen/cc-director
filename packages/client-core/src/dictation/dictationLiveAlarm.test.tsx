// The live capture alarm, at the JOIN between the recorder's liveness clocks and the dialog that has
// to say something about them. The clocks themselves are unit-tested in recorder.test.ts; what is
// pinned HERE is the wiring, because the wiring is what was missing for the whole life of this
// defect: the recorder could already read a flat-zero meter and the dialog drew it as nine short bars
// and said nothing, so a dead meter and a quiet user were the same picture, and a recording that had
// stopped hearing anything looked exactly like a recording that was going fine.
//
// The alarm must:
//   - stay silent while capture and the meter are both alive,
//   - say the recording has STALLED when no audio has been delivered (words are being lost NOW),
//   - say we are hearing NOTHING when the meter has been pinned at zero (dead meter, or a muted mic),
//   - prefer the stall message over the silence message, since a stalled recorder usually goes silent
//     too and the losing-your-words one is the message that matters,
//   - and CLEAR itself the moment the microphone recovers - a warning that outlives its cause trains
//     the user to ignore the one that does not.
//
// Revert-proof: delete either threshold branch in DictationDialog's animation loop and the matching
// assertion below reddens; make the alarm sticky instead of self-clearing and the recovery test fails.

// The controllable microphone. The test moves these two clocks; nothing else about it matters.
