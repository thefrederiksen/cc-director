// Self-healing recovery for a stale service-worker shell (issue #1155).
//
// The mobile app is an offline-capable Progressive Web App: its service worker precaches the app
// shell and serves navigations from that cache. When a new build adds a client-side route, a
// returning browser can still be served the PREVIOUSLY cached shell for a load (the service worker
// serves cache-first, and a new worker only takes control on a later load). If that cached shell's
// router does not know the route being navigated to - the device-enrollment callback
// (/mobile/device-callback) is the one that bit us - React Router renders its raw "404 Not Found" and the
// user dead-ends, unable to sign in.
//
// skipWaiting + clientsClaim (already on via registerType: "autoUpdate") do NOT prevent this: the old
// worker has already rendered the stale shell before the background update+reload can win the race.
// The only deterministic cure is to recover AT the point of failure: when a navigation matches no
// route, throw away the service worker and its caches and reload once, which forces the browser to
// fetch the current shell straight from the Gateway (the Gateway always serves the up-to-date
// index.html with no-cache). After that reload the router is current and the route resolves.
//
// A single per-session guard prevents a reload loop: a genuinely non-existent URL cannot self-heal,
// so after one refresh we stop and show a plain message instead of reloading forever.
