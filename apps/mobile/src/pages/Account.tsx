// The phone's Account screen (devthrottle_internal #1507, #1509). Until this existed the mobile app
// had no account destination at all and no way to sign out: the only ways off a signed-in phone were
// clearing browser storage by hand or revoking the device on devthrottle.com.
//
// The screen is a FRAME, not a page: everything inside it is the shared AccountsPanel the desktop
// Cockpit mounts too, so the two surfaces cannot drift (CLAUDE.md rule 8). The phone supplies the back
// link, the app bar, and the route that "Add account" leads to.
